  <i>For the first time, RubyKaigi offered simultaneous<br/>

</div>
<p><a href="http://rubykaigi.org">RubyKaigi</a> is the largest Ruby conference in Japan,
Ruby’s home country. It was started in 2006 as a Japanese-only conference; that
year David Heinemeier Hansson was the only non-Japanese presenter. But
gradually year by year RubyKaigi gained more and more foreign attendees and
content. This year, after a two year hiatus, RubyKaigi was reinvented and has
become more international than ever. In fact, for the first time much of the
conference’s content was translated live from Japanese to English.</p>
<p>But what does it mean to translate a conference, exactly? How did the
conference organizers do it? Did it work? What did foreign attendees think? Did
they get anything out of the conference? From a distance, I was fascinated!</p>

</div>
<p>To find out more, Chris and I decided to talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/kakutani">Shintaro
Kakutani</a>, the principal organizer of the
conference. He and his team used some innovative techniques to translate
the Japanese content into English, making the conference more accessible and
fun than ever. We also spoke with a couple of foreign Rubyists who attended the
conference to see how well the translation worked for them.</p>
<h2>What was different about this year’s RubyKaigi?</h2>
<p>We asked Kakutani-san about what the organizers did differently at this year's
event. He explained:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  First off, to make it clear that we weren't organizing this event just for
  the Japan Ruby community, we made a point of announcing the conference in
  English.
  </p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  Talks were a bit more difficult. Many of the Japanese speakers, the most
  proficient Rubyists in Japan, would have struggled in English and the
  technically significant points they were trying to express would have been
  lost. So instead, we decided to hire professional Japanese to English
  interpreters to translate all Japanese talks.
  </p>
  <p>
  There were also Japanese Rubyists such as Akira Matsuda who gave his talk in
  English, and non-Japanese Rubyists such as Aaron Patterson and John Foley who
  gave part of their talks in Japanese. I hope we have more talks like this in
  the future.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we asked him about how international the conference was this year, he said:</p>
<div style="float: right; padding: 7px 0px 10px 30px; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
  <img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/6/24/map.jpg"><br/>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p>
   At RubyKaigi, we always setup a world map in a lounge somewhere and get
   attendees to stick a Post It note on the map to show where they came from. 
  </p>
  <p>
  This year we literally had Rubyists from all corners of the world in Tokyo.
  The success of this aspect of this year's RubyKaigi went well beyond our
  expectations.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  It's very important to us that when all these Rubyists from all over the
  world, with different backgrounds and different values, come together, they
  feel at home here and are able to enjoy themselves. This is something that I
  want to continue to improve. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Simultaneous translation</h2>
<p>For the first time, RubyKaigi offered simultaneous translation from Japanese to
English through the use of headsets. Non-Japanese attendees were able to listen to the Japanese
presentations live and not miss a thing. During the conference there was some
positive feedback about this on Twitter.</p>

  <i>According to Richard, Aaron Patterson wrote this pun<br/>
   in Japanese: "At the evento have a bento"</i>
</div>
<p>To learn more we asked <a href="https://twitter.com/schneems">Richard Schneeman</a>, on the Ruby team at
Heroku and Adjunct Professor at the University of Texas Austin, what he thought
of the simultaneous translation.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  Japanese talks were translated to English live. If you wanted to listen to
  the translation you could grab a radio headset and tune to the right channel.
  I spoke to Matz and Koichi before the talks and they said all Japanese
  presenters had to sit with the translator for an hour to show them their
  slides and help them with technical words. This resulted in very accurate and
  technical translations.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Richard did think some of the humor might have been lost in translation.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  While not all of the jokes were translated well, all of the technical
  material was. The majority of the slide decks were in English, but many jokes
  and some other non-technical content was in Japanese.
  </p>

</div>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/saturnflyer">Jim Gay</a>, lead developer for Radiant CMS and
the author of <a href="http://www.clean-ruby.com">Clean Ruby</a>, was similarly positive
about the simultaneous translation.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  Translation services were impressive. Professionals seemed to
  be translating technical terms with ease.  Without this I would have been
  lost. I actually tried to sit through a Japanese presentation but only got a
  few minutes in before I decided to get the translation earphone. Several
  (maybe most) presentations had slides in English but presenters spoke in
  Japanese. This definitely helped.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conference organizers also arranged for a projector showing an IRC channel
on stage, right next to the speakers and the main presentation slides. This
provided a way to crowd source the translation and also helped build a sense of
community at the conference.</p>
<h2>An open invitation!</h2>
<p>Finally, Kakutani-san wanted us to pass along this invitation to Rubyists
living outside of Japan.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
RubyKaigi brings together more Ruby developers than any other conference in the
world. This is an event for all Rubyists, around the world, who want to improve
the Ruby language. We hope to see many more international Rubyists at the next
RubyKaigi and look forward to your talks and to your support.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there you have it: an open invitation to come to Ruby’s home country and
meet the community that invented this amazing language that we all know and
love. Japan may be a long way to travel, but we can rest assured we’ll be in
good hands next year at RubyKaigi 2014!</p>
