<p>This year <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> was an inspiring, enthusiastic and fun experience. If you weren&apos;t lucky enough to be able to attend in person, I would highly recommend taking a look at <a href="http://rubyconf13.multifaceted.io">http://rubyconf13.multifaceted.io</a>, a multimedia site about RubyConf put together by <a href="http://www.ninefold.com">Ninefold</a>, a Sydney Rails hosting firm. They collected an amazing set of speaker interviews, slides, talk summaries, and tweets from the conference. And just this week Confreaks has started posting the <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/events/rubyconf2013">session videos online</a>; there are many sessions I missed in person that I can’t wait to see.</p>
<p>Today, however, I'd like to pass along a few tidbits of technical knowledge I learned during the conference that <em>surprised</em> me. Aside from all the great people I met during hallway, dinner and lunch conversations, the surprising bits of knowledge are what stand out in my memory as I write this, three weeks after the conference ended.</p>
