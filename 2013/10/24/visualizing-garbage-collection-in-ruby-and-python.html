  Note: This post is based on a presentation I just did at <a href="http://13.rupy.eu">RuPy</a> in Budapest.
  Instead of just posting my slides I thought it would be more useful if I wrote
  it down as a blog post while it’s still fresh in my mind. You can
also watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzEekAnAS_g">video recording of the
presentation</a>. FYI I’m planning to
do a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl_zYzPiDto">similar presentation
at RubyConf</a>, except I’ll remove the Python info, and instead compare how GC
works inside of MRI vs.  JRuby and Rubinius.</p>
<p> For a more detailed explanation of GC in Ruby and of Ruby internals
  generally, see my upcoming book, <a href="http://nostarch.com/rum">Ruby Under
  a Microscope</a>, due out very soon from No Starch Press.</p> </b>

  <i>If your algorithms and business logic are the brain of your<br/>
  application, which organ would the garbage collector be?</i>
</div>
<p>Since this is the “Ruby Python” conference, I thought it would be fun to
compare how garbage collection works inside of Ruby and Python. But before we
get to that, why talk about garbage collection at all? After all, it’s not the
most glamorous, exciting topic, is it? How many of you get excited by
garbage collection? [ A number of RuPy attendees actually raised their hands! ]</p>
<p>Recently in the Ruby community there was a <a href="http://fredwu.me/post/60441991350/protip-ruby-devs-please-tweak-your-gc-settings-for">blog
post</a>
about how you can speed up your unit tests by changing your Ruby GC settings. I
think that’s great. It’s good to run your tests faster and to run your app with
fewer GC pauses, but somehow GC doesn’t really <em>excite</em> me. It seems like a
boring, dry, technical topic at first glance.</p>
<p>But actually, garbage collection is a fascinating topic: GC algorithms are both
an important part of computer science history, and a subject of cutting edge
research. For example, the Mark and Sweep algorithm used by MRI Ruby is over 50
years old, while one of the GC algorithms used inside of Rubinius, an
alternative implementation of Ruby, was invented just recently in 2008.</p>
<p>However, the name “garbage collection,” is actually misnomer.</p>
<h2>The Beating Heart of Your Application</h2>
<p>GC systems do much more than just “collect garbage.” In fact, they perform
three important tasks. They</p>
<ul>
<li>allocate memory for new objects,</li>
<li>identify garbage objects, and</li>
<li>reclaim memory from garbage objects.</li>
</ul>
<div style="float: right; padding: 7px 0px 10px 30px; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
  <img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/heart-polish.png"><br/>
</div>
<p>Imagine if your application was a human body: All of the elegant code you
write, your business logic, your algorithms, would be the brain or the
intelligence inside the application. Following this analogy, what part of the
body do you think the garbage collector would be? [ I got lots of fun answers from the RuPy audience: kidneys, white blood cells :) ]</p>
<p>I think the garbage collector is the beating heart of your application. Just as
your heart provides blood and nutrients to the rest of the your body, the
garbage collector provides memory and objects for your application to use. If
your heart stopped beating you would die in seconds. If the garbage collector
stopped or ran slowly - if it had clogged arteries - your
application would slow down and eventually die!</p>
<h2>A Simple Example</h2>
<p>It’s always helpful to work through theories using examples. Here’s a simple
class, written in both Python and Ruby, that we can use as an example today:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/code.png"><br/></p>
<p>By the way, it’s amazing to me how similar this code is in both languages: Ruby
and Python are really just slightly different ways of saying the same thing.
But are the languages also <em>implemented</em> in a similar way internally?</p>
<h2>The Free List</h2>
<p>When we call <span class="code">Node.new(1)</span> above, what does Ruby do,
exactly? How does Ruby go about creating a new object for us?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it does very little! In fact, long before your code starts to
run, Ruby creates thousands of objects ahead of time and places them on a linked
list, called the <em>free list</em>. Here’s what the free list might look like,
conceptually:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/free-list1.png"><br/></p>
<p>Imagine each of the white squares above is an unused, precreated Ruby object.
When we call <span class="code">Node.new</span>, Ruby simply takes one of these objects and hands it to
us:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/free-list2.png"><br/></p>
<p>In the diagram above, the gray square on the left represents an active Ruby
object we’re using in our code, while the remaining white squares are unused
objects. [ Note: of course, my diagrams are a simplified version of reality. In
fact, Ruby would use another object to hold the string “ABC,” a third object to
hold the class definition of Node, and still other objects to hold the parsed,
abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of my code, etc. ]</p>
<p>If we call <span class="code">Node.new</span> again, Ruby just hands
us another object:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/free-list3.png"><br/></p>

</div>
<p>This simple algorithm of using a linked list of precreated objects was
invented over 50 years ago by a legendary computer scientist named John
McCarthy, while he was working on the original implementation of Lisp. Lisp was
not only one of the first functional programming languages, but also contained
a number of other groundbreaking advances in computer science. One of these was
the concept of automatically managing your application’s memory using garbage
collection.</p>
<p>The standard version of Ruby, also known as “Matz’s Ruby Interpreter” (MRI),
uses a GC algorithm similar to the one used by McCarthy’s implementation
of Lisp in 1960. For better or worse, Ruby uses a 53 year old algorithm for
garbage collection. Just as Lisp did, Ruby creates objects ahead of time and
hands them to your code when you allocate new objects or values.</p>
<h2>Allocating Objects in Python</h2>
<p>We’ve seen that Ruby creates objects ahead of time and saves them in the free
list. What about Python?</p>
<p>While Python also uses free lists for various reasons internally (it recycles
certain objects such as lists), it normally allocates memory for new objects
and values differently than Ruby does.</p>
<p>Suppose we create a Node object using Python:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/python1.png"><br/></p>
<p>Python, unlike Ruby, will ask the operating system for memory immediately when
you create the object. (Python actually implements its own memory allocation
system which provides an additional layer of abstraction on top of the OS heap.
But I don’t have time to get into those details today.)</p>
<p>When we create a second object, Python will again ask the OS for more memory:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/python2.png"><br/></p>
<div style="float: right; padding: 7px 0px 10px 30px; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
  <img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/mess.jpg"><br/>
  <i>Ruby leaves unused objects lying around in<br/>memory until the next GC process runs.</i>
</div>
<p>Seems simple enough; at the moment we create an object Python takes the time to
find and allocate memory for us.</p>
<h2>Ruby Developers Live in a Messy House</h2>
<p>Back to Ruby. As we allocate more and more objects, Ruby will continue to hand
us precreated objects from the free list. As it does this, the free list will
become shorter:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/free-list4.png"><br/></p>
<p>...and shorter:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/free-list5.png"><br/></p>
<p>Notice as I continue to assign new values to <span class="code">n1</span>, Ruby
leaves the old values behind. The ABC, JKL and MNO nodes remain in memory. Ruby
doesn’t immediately clean up old objects my code is no longer using! Working as
a Ruby developer is like living in a messy house, with clothes lying on the
floor or dirty dishes in the kitchen sink. As a Ruby developer you have to work
with unused, garbage objects surrounding you.</p>
<div style="clear: right"></div>
<h2>Python Developers Live in a Tidy Household</h2>
<div style="float: right; padding: 7px 0px 10px 30px; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
  <img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/clean.jpg"><br/>
  <i>Python cleans up garbage objects immediately <br/>
    after your code is done using them.</i>
</div>
<p>Garbage collection works quite differently in Python than in Ruby. Let’s return
to our three Python Node objects from earlier:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/python3b.png"><br/></p>
<p>Internally, whenever we create an object Python saves an integer inside the
object’s C structure, called the <em>reference count</em>. Initially, Python sets this
value to 1:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/python4.png"><br/></p>
<p>The value of 1 indicates there is one pointer or reference to each of the three
objects. Now suppose we create a new node, JKL:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/python5.png"><br/></p>
<p>Just as before, Python sets the reference count in JKL to be 1. However, also
notice since we changed <span class="code">n1</span> to point to JKL, it no
longer references ABC, and that Python decremented its reference count down to 0.</p>
<p>At this point, the Python garbage collector immediately jumps into action! Whenever an
object’s reference count reaches zero, Python immediately frees it, returning
it’s memory to the operating system:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/python6.png"><br/></p>
<p>Above Python reclaims the memory used by the ABC node. Remember, Ruby simply
leaves old objects lying around and doesn’t release their memory.</p>
<p>This garbage collection algorithm is known as <em>reference counting</em>. It was
invented by George Collins in 1960 - not coincidentally the same year John
McCarthy invented the free list algorithm. As <a href="https://twitter.com/mrb_bk">Mike Bernstein</a> said in his
fantastic <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2545-goruco2013-to-know-a-garbage-collector">presentation on garbage collection</a>
at the <a href="http://goruco.com">Gotham Ruby Conference</a> back in June: <i>“1960 was a good year for Garbage Collectors....”</i></p>
<p>Working as a Python developer is like living in a tidy house; you know, the
kind of place where your roommates are a bit OCD and are constantly cleaning up
after you. As soon as you put down a dirty dish or glass, someone has already
put it away in the dishwasher!</p>
<p>Now for a second example. Suppose we set <span class="code">n2</span> to refer
to the same node as <span class="code">n1</span>:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/python8.png"><br/></p>
<p>Above to the left you can see Python has decremented the reference count for
DEF and will immediately garbage collect the DEF node. Also note that the JKL
now has a reference count of 2, since both <span class="code">n1</span> and
<span class="code">n2</span> point to it.</p>
<h2>Mark and Sweep</h2>
<p>Eventually a messy house fills up with trash and life can’t continue as usual.
After your Ruby program runs for some time, the free list will eventually be
entirely used up:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/mark-and-sweep1.png"><br/></p>
<p>Here all of the precreated Ruby objects have been used by our application
(they are all gray) and no objects remain on the free list (no white squares
are left).</p>
<p>At this point Ruby uses another algorithm invented by McCarthy known as <em>Mark
and Sweep</em>. First Ruby stops your application; Ruby uses “stop the world garbage
collection.” Ruby then loops through all of the pointers, variables and other
references our code makes to objects and other values. Ruby also iterates over
internal pointers used by its virtual machine. It <em>marks</em> each object that
it is able to reach using these pointers. I indicate these marks using the letter M
here:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/mark-and-sweep2.png"><br/></p>
<p>Above the three objects marked with “M” are live, active objects that our
application is still using. Internally, Ruby actually uses a series of bits
known as the <em>free bitmap</em> to keep track of which objects are marked or not:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/mark-and-sweep3.png"><br/></p>
<p>Ruby saves the free bitmap in a separate memory location in order to take full
advantage of Unix copy-on-write optimization. For more information on this, see
my article <a
  href="https://patshaughnessy.net/2012/3/23/why-you-should-be-excited-about-garbage-collection-in-ruby-2-0">Why
You Should Be Excited About Garbage Collection in Ruby 2.0.</a></p>
<p>If the marked objects are live, the remaining, unmarked objects must be garbage,
meaning they are no longer being used by our code. I’ll show the garbage objects
as white squares below:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/mark-and-sweep4.png"><br/></p>
<p>Next Ruby <em>sweeps</em> the unused, garbage objects back onto the free list:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/24/mark-and-sweep5.png"><br/></p>
<p>Internally this happens quite quickly, since Ruby doesn’t actually copy objects
around from one place to another. Instead, Ruby places the garbage objects back
onto the free list by adjusting internal pointers to form a new linked list.</p>
<p>Now Ruby can give these garbage objects back to us the next time we create a
new Ruby object. In Ruby, objects are reincarnated, and enjoy multiple lives!</p>
<h2>Mark and Sweep vs. Reference Counting</h2>
<p>At first glance, Python’s GC algorithm seems far superior to Ruby’s: why live
in a messy house when you can live in a tidy one? Why does Ruby force your
application to stop running periodically each time it cleans up, instead of
using Python’s algorithm?</p>
<p>Reference counting isn’t as simple as it seems at first glance, however. There
are a number of reasons why many languages don’t use a reference counting GC
algorithm like Python does:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, it’s difficult to implement. Python has to leave room inside of each
object to hold the reference count. There’s a minor space penalty for this. But
worse, a simple operation such a changing a variable or reference becomes a
more complex operation since Python needs to increment one counter, decrement
another, and possibly free the object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, it can be slower. Although Python performs GC work smoothly
as your application runs (cleaning dirty dishes as soon as you put them in the
sink), this isn’t necessarily faster. Python is constantly updating the
reference count values. And when you stop using a large data structure, such as
a list containing many elements, Python might have to free many objects all at
once. Decrementing reference counts can be a complex, recursive process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, it doesn’t always work. As we’ll see in my next post containing my
notes from the rest of this presentation, reference counting can’t handle
<em>cyclic data structures</em> - data structures that contain circular references.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Until Next Time...</h2>
<p>Next week I’ll type up <a href="https://patshaughnessy.net/2013/10/30/generational-gc-in-python-and-ruby">the rest of the presentation</a>. I’ll discuss how Python
handles cyclic data structures, and how GC works in the upcoming Ruby 2.1 release.</p>
