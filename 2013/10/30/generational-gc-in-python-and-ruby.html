  <i>Both the Ruby and Python garbage collectors<br/>
  handle old and young objects differently.</i>
</div>
<p><a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2013/10/24/visualizing-garbage-collection-in-ruby-and-python">Last week I wrote up the my first half of my notes</a>
from a presentation I did at <a href="http://13.rupy.eu">RuPy</a> called “Visualizing
Garbage Collection in Ruby and Python.” I explained how standard Ruby (also
known as Matz’s Ruby Interpreter or MRI) uses a garbage collection (GC)
algorithm called <em>mark and sweep</em>, the same basic algorithm developed for the
original version of Lisp in 1960. We also saw how Python uses a very different
GC algorithm also invented 53 years ago called <em>reference counting</em>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, along with reference counting Python employs a second
algorithm called <em>generational garbage collection</em>. This means Python’s garbage
collector handles newly created objects differently than older ones. And
starting with the upcoming version 2.1 release, MRI Ruby will also employ
generational GC for the first time. (Two alternative implementations of Ruby,
JRuby and Rubinius, have been using generational garbage collection for years.
I’ll talk about how garbage collection works inside of JRuby and Rubinius next
week at <a href="http://rubyconf.org/program#pat-shaughnessy">RubyConf</a>.)</p>
<p>Of course, the phrase “handles new objects differently from older ones” is a
bit of hand-waving. What exactly are new and old objects? Exactly how do Ruby
and Python handle them differently? Today I’ll continue to describe how these
two garbage collectors work and answer these questions. But before we
get to generational GC, we first need to learn more about a serious theoretical
problem with Python’s reference counting algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> If you speak Russian, there's a <a href="http://howtorecover.me/generiruusii-gc-v-python-i-ruby">translation of this
article</a> by Vlad Brown
on <a href="http://howtorecover.me">HTR</a>.</p>
<h2>Cyclic Data Structures and Reference Counting in Python</h2>
<p>We saw last time that Python uses an integer value saved inside of each object,
known as the <em>reference count</em>, to keep track of how many pointers reference that
object. Whenever a variable or other object in your program starts to refer to
an object, Python increments this counter; when your program stops using an
object, Python decrements the counter. Once the reference count becomes zero,
Python frees the object and reclaims its memory.</p>
<p>Since the 1960s, computer scientists have been aware of a theoretical problem
with this algorithm: if one of your data structures refers to itself, if it is a
<em>cyclic data structure</em>, some of the reference counts will never become zero. To
better understand this problem let’s take an example. The code below shows the
same <span class="code">Node</span> class we used last week:</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/cycle1.png"><br/></p>
<p>We have a constructor (these are called <span class="code">__init__</span> in Python) which saves a
single attribute in an instance variable. Below the class definition we create
two nodes, ABC and DEF, which I represent using the rectangles on the left. The
reference count inside both of our nodes is initially one, since one pointer
(<span class="code">n1</span> and <span class="code">n2</span>, respectively) refers to each node.</p>
<p>Now let’s define two additional attributes in our nodes, <span class="code">next</span> and <span class="code">prev</span>:</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/cycle2.png"><br/></p>
<p>Unlike in Ruby, using Python you can define instance variables or object
attributes on the fly like this. This seems like a bit of interesting magic
missing from Ruby. (Disclaimer: I’m not a Python developer so I might have some
of the nomenclature wrong here.) We set <span class="code">n1.next</span> to
reference <span class="code">n2</span>, and <span class="code">n2.prev</span>
to point back to <span class="code">n1</span>. Now our two nodes form a doubly
linked list using a circular pattern of pointers. Also notice that the
reference counts of both ABC and DEF have increased to two.  There are two
pointers referring to each node: <span class="code">n1</span> and <span
class="code">n2</span> as before, and now <span class="code">next</span> and
<span class="code">prev</span> as well.</p>
<p>Now let’s suppose our Python program stops using the nodes; we set both <span
class="code">n1</span> and <span class="code">n2</span> to null. (In Python
null is known as <span class="code">None</span>.)</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/cycle3.png"><br/></p>
<p>Now Python, as usual, decrements the reference count inside of each node down to 1.</p>
<h2>Generation Zero in Python</h2>
<p>Notice in the diagram just above we’ve ended up with an unusual situation: We
have an “island” or a group of unused objects that refer to each other, but
which have no external references. In other words, our program is no longer
using either node object, therefore we expect Python’s garbage collector to be
smart enough to free both objects and reclaim their memory for other purposes.
But this doesn’t happen because both reference counts are one and not zero.
Python’s reference counting algorithm can’t handle objects that refer to each
other!</p>
<p>Of course, this is a contrived example, but your own programs might contain
circular references like this in subtle ways that you may not be aware of. In
fact, as your Python program runs over time it will build up a certain amount
of “floating garbage,” unused objects that the Python collector is unable to
process because the reference counts never reach zero.</p>
<p>This is where Python’s generational algorithm comes in! Just as Ruby keeps
track of unused, free objects using a linked list (the <em>free list</em>), Python uses a
different linked list to keep track of active objects. Instead of calling this
the “active list,” Python’s internal C code refers to it as <em>Generation Zero</em>.
Each time you create an object or some other value in your program, Python adds
it to the Generation Zero linked list:</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/python-gen1.png"><br/></p>
<p>Above you can see when we create the ABC node, Python adds it to Generation
Zero. Note that this isn’t an actual list that you see and access in your
program; this linked list is entirely internal to the Python runtime.</p>
<p>Similarly, when we create the DEF node, Python adds it to the same linked list:</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/python-gen2.png"><br/></p>
<p>Now Generation Zero contains two node objects. (It will also contain every
other value our Python code creates, and many internal values used by Python
itself.)</p>
<h2>Detecting Cyclic References</h2>
<p>Later Python loops through the objects in the Generation Zero list and checks
which other objects each object in the list refers to, decrementing reference
counts as it goes. In this way, Python accounts for internal references from
one object to another that prevented Python from freeing the objects earlier.</p>
<p>To make this a bit easier to understand, let’s take an example:</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/python-gen3.png"><br/></p>
<p>Above you can see the ABC and DEF nodes contain a reference count of 1. Three
other objects are in the Generation Zero linked list also. The blue arrows
indicate some of the objects are referred to by other objects that are located
elsewhere - references from outside of Generation Zero. (As we’ll see in a
moment, Python also uses two other lists called Generation One and Generation
Two.) These objects have higher reference counts because of the other pointers
referring to them.</p>
<p>Below you can see what happens after Python’s garbage collector processes
Generation Zero.</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/python-gen4.png"><br/></p>
<p>By identifying internal references, Python is able to reduce the reference
count of many of the Generation Zero objects. Above in the top row you can see
that ABC and DEF now have a reference count of zero. This means the collector
will free them and reclaim their memory. The remaining live objects are then
moved to a new linked list: Generation One.</p>
<p>In a way, Python’s GC algorithm resembles the mark and sweep algorithm Ruby
uses. Periodically it traces references from one object to another to determine
which objects remain live, active objects our program is still using - just
like Ruby’s marking process.</p>
<h2>Garbage Collection Thresholds in Python</h2>
<p>When does Python perform this marking process? As your Python program runs, the
interpreter keeps track of how many new objects it allocates, and how many
objects it frees because of zero reference counts. Theoretically, these two
values should remain the same: every new object your program creates should
eventually be freed.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t the case. Because of circular references, and because
your program uses some objects longer than others, the difference between the
allocation count and the release count slowly grows. Once this delta value
reaches a certain threshold, Python’s collector is triggered and processes the
Generation Zero list using the subtract algorithm above, releasing the
“floating garbage” and moving the surviving objects to Generation One.</p>
<p>Over time, objects that your Python program continues to use for a long time
are migrated from the Generation Zero list to Generation One. Python processes
the objects on the Generation One list in a similar way, after the
allocation-release count delta value reaches an even higher threshold value.
Python moves the remaining, active objects over to the Generation Two list.</p>
<p>In this way, the objects that your Python program uses for long periods of
time, that your code keeps active references to, move from Generation Zero to
One to Two. Using different threshold values, Python processes these objects at
different intervals. Python processes objects in Generation Zero most
frequently, Generation One less frequently, and Generation Two even less often.</p>
<h2>The Weak Generational Hypothesis</h2>
<p>This behavior is the crux of the generational garbage collection algorithm: the
collector processes new objects more frequently than old objects. A new, or
<em>young</em> object is one that your program has just created, while an old or <em>mature</em>
object is one that has remained active for some period of time. Python <em>promotes</em>
an object when it moves it from Generation Zero to One, or from One to Two.</p>
<p>Why do this? The fundamental idea behind this algorithm is known as the <em>weak
generational hypothesis</em>. The hypothesis actually consists of two ideas: that
most new objects die young, while older objects are likely to remain active for
a long time.</p>
<p>Suppose I create a new object using Python or Ruby:</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/weak-gen1.png"><br/></p>
<p>According to the hypothesis, my code is likely to use the new ABC node only for a
short time.   The object is probably just an intermediate value used inside of
one method and will become garbage as soon as the method returns. Most new
objects will become garbage quickly in this way. Occasionally, however, my
program creates a few objects that remain important for a longer time - such as
session variables or configuration values in a web application.</p>
<p>By processing the new objects in Generation Zero more frequently, Python’s
garbage collector spends most of its time where it will benefit the most: it
processes the new objects which will quickly and frequently become garbage.
Only rarely, when the allocation threshold value increases, does Python’s
collector process the older objects.</p>
<h2>Back to the Free List in Ruby</h2>
<p>The upcoming release of Ruby, version 2.1, now uses a generational garbage
collector algorithm for the first time! (Remember, other implementations of
Ruby, such as JRuby and Rubinius, have been using this idea for years.) Let’s
return to the free list diagrams from <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2013/10/24/visualizing-garbage-collection-in-ruby-and-python">my last post</a>
to understand how this works.</p>
<p>Recall that when the free list is used up, Ruby marks the objects your program
is still using:</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/ruby-gen1.png"><br/></p>
<p>In this diagram, we see there are three active objects because the pointers <span class="code">n1</span>,
<span class="code">n2</span> and <span class="code">n3</span> still refer to
them. The remaining objects, the white squares, are garbage. (Of course, the
free list will actually contain thousands of objects that refer to each other
in complex patterns. My simple diagrams help me communicate the basic ideas
behind Ruby’s GC algorithm without getting bogged down in the details.)</p>
<p>Also recall that Ruby moves the garbage objects back onto the free list,
because now they can be recycled and reused by your program when it allocates new
objects:</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/ruby-gen2.png"><br/></p>
<h2>Generational GC in Ruby 2.1</h2>
<p>Starting with Ruby 2.1, the GC code takes an additional step: it promotes the
remaining active objects to the <em>mature generation</em>. (The MRI C source code
actually uses the word <em>old</em> and not <em>mature</em>.) This diagram shows a conceptual
view of the two Ruby 2.1 object generations:</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/ruby-gen3.png"><br/></p>
<p>On the left is a different view of the free list. We see the garbage objects in
white, and the remaining live, active objects in gray. The gray objects were
just marked.</p>
<p>Once the mark and sweep process is finished, Ruby 2.1 will consider the
remaining marked objects to be mature:</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/ruby-gen4.png"><br/></p>
<p>Instead of using three generations like Python, Ruby 2.1’s garbage collector
uses just two. On the left are new objects in the young generation, and on the
right are old objects in the mature generation. Once Ruby 2.1 has marked an
object once, it considers it to be mature. Ruby bets the object has remained
active for a long enough time that it will not become garbage quickly.</p>
<p>Important note: Ruby 2.1 doesn’t actually copy objects around in memory. These
generations don’t consist of different areas of physical memory. (Some GC
algorithms used by other languages and other Ruby implementations, known as
<em>copying garbage collectors</em>, do actually copy objects when they are promoted.)
Instead, Ruby 2.1 uses code internally that doesn’t include previously marked
objects in the mark and sweep process again. Once an object has been marked
once it won’t be included in the next mark and sweep process.</p>
<p>Now suppose your Ruby program continues to run, creating more new, young
objects. These appear in the young generation again, on the left:</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/ruby-gen5.png"><br/></p>
<p>Just like Python, Ruby’s collector focuses its efforts on the young generation.
It only includes the new, young objects created since the last GC process
occurred in the mark and sweep algorithm. This is because many new objects are
likely to be garbage already (the white boxes on the left). Ruby doesn’t
re-mark the mature objects on the right. Because they already survived one GC
process, they are likely to remain active and not become garbage for a longer
time. By only marking young objects, Ruby’s GC code runs much faster. It just
skips over the mature objects entirely, reducing the amount of time your
program is waiting for garbage collection to finish.</p>
<p>Occasionally Ruby runs a “full collection,” re-marking and re-sweeping the
mature objects as well. Ruby decides when to run a full collection by
monitoring the number of mature objects. When the number of mature objects has
doubled since the last full collection, Ruby clears the marks and considers all
the objects to be young again.</p>
<h2>Write Barriers</h2>
<p>One important challenge to this algorithm is worth further explanation. Suppose
your code creates a new, young object and adds it as a child of an existing,
mature object. For example, this would happen if you added a new value to an
array that had existed for a long time.</p>
<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/10/30/ruby-gen6.png"><br/></p>
<p>Here again on the left we see new, young objects and mature objects on the
right. On the left side the marking process has identified that 5 new objects
are still active (gray), while two new objects are garbage (white). But what
about the new, young object in the center? This is the one shown in white with
a question mark. Is this new object garbage or active?</p>
<p>It’s active, of course, because there’s a reference to it from a mature object
on the right. But  remember Ruby 2.1 doesn’t include mature objects in mark and
sweep (until a full collection occurs). This means the new object will be
incorrectly considered garbage and released, causing your program to lose data!</p>
<p>Ruby 2.1 overcomes this challenge by monitoring the mature objects to see if
your program adds a reference from them to a new, young object. Ruby 2.1 uses
an old GC technique called <em>write barriers</em> to monitor changes to mature
objects - whenever you add a reference from one object to another (whenever you
write to or modify an object), a write barrier is triggered.  The barriers
check whether the source object is mature, and if so adds the mature object to
a special list. Later Ruby 2.1 includes these just these modified mature
objects in the next mark and sweep process, preventing active, young objects
from being incorrectly considered garbage.</p>
<p>Ruby 2.1’s actual implementation of write barriers is quite complex, primarily
because existing C extensions don’t contain them. Koichi Sasada and the Ruby
core team used a number of clever solutions to overcome this challenge as well.
To learn more about these technical details, watch <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/35107339/highlight/377033">Koichi’s fascinating
presentation</a> from <a href="http://euruko2013.org">EuRuKo 2013</a>.</p>
<h2>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</h2>
<p>At first glance, Ruby and Python seem to implement garbage collection very
differently. Ruby uses John McCarthy’s original mark and sweep algorithm, while
Python uses reference counting. But when we look more closely, we see that
Python uses bits of the mark and sweep idea to handle cyclic references, and
that both Ruby and Python use generational garbage collection in similar ways.
Python uses three separate generations, while Ruby 2.1 uses two.</p>
<p>This similarity should not be a surprise. Both languages are using computer
science research that was done decades ago - before either Ruby or Python were
even invented. I find it fascinating that when you look “under the hood” at
different programming languages, you often find the same fundamental ideas and
algorithms are used by all of them. Modern programming languages owe a great
deal to the ground breaking computer science research that John McCarthy and
his contemporaries did back in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
