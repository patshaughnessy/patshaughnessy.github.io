<p><a href="https://patshaughnessy.net/2013/1/23/ruby-mri-source-code-idioms-1-accessing-data-via-macros">Last
week</a>
I discussed how Ruby’s C source code uses macros to access data values. I
explained that this “MRI Idiom” can make Ruby’s source a bit confusing for C
programmers to read, but at the same time can make it easier to follow for Ruby
developers who aren’t experienced with C. Today I want to continue this series
and talk about another MRI idiom: how Ruby’s C source code frequently resembles
Ruby code.</p>
<p>Sounds hard to believe, doesn’t it? At first glance MRI’s C source code looks
nothing like Ruby. For example, take a look at the implementation of
<span class="code">Array#collect</span>:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/rb_ary_collect1.png"/>
<p>This is typical C code: verbose, confusing and hard to understand. Ruby is
supposed to be elegant and concise! However, I honestly believe this C code
does resemble Ruby, and in fact implements <span
  class="code">Array#collect</span> just the way you would if you were to
implement this in Ruby.</p>
<p>Of course, we don’t need to imagine how we would implement this in Ruby - there
already is a Ruby version of <span class="code">Array#collect</span> (actually
<span class="code">Enumerable#collect</span>) in <a href="http://rubini.us">Rubinius</a>:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/rubinius1.png"/>
<p>Now let’s take a second look at MRI’s C implementation - if you have a vivid
imagination you can see how the MRI C code corresponds to the Ruby used by
Rubinius:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/rb_ary_collect2.png"/>
<p>My point is that by learning a few of MRI’s idioms and coding patterns, you can
begin to read Ruby’s C source code just as easily as you can read Rubinius’s
Ruby implementation.</p>
<p>Why would you want to do this? Why not refer to the Rubinius source code base
whenever you have a question about how something works? This is actually a
great idea; Rubinius is a particularly beautiful implementation of Ruby, and
reading its code can give you a lot of insight into what’s going on inside of
Ruby. However, most of us don’t run Rubinius in production. If you really need
to know how something works at a detailed level... why it is slow, why it is
fast, how or when does it allocate memory, etc., then there is no alternative
but to read the C code you are actually running in production.</p>
<p>Today I’m going to examine how the C constructs in <span
  class="code">rb_ary_collect</span> work in detail, and show how we can
replace them - in our minds at least - with the corresponding Ruby code. By
investing a bit of time to learn just a few of MRI’s coding patterns you’ll be
able to understand not only <span class="code">rb_ary_collect,</span> but many
of the built in methods from classes such as String, Array, or File that you
use everyday in your code.  Understanding MRI’s idioms will allow you to follow
much of Ruby’s internal source code without being an expert C developer.</p>
<h2>First, a review of what Array#collect does</h2>
<p>Let’s start by reviewing how the <span class="code">collect</span> method works in Ruby. Here’s the
example from the Ruby documentation:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/ruby-example1.png"/>
<p>Most of the time we use <span class="code">collect</span> to iterate over an array (or some other
Enumerable) and call a block for each element. Later <span class="code">collect</span> pushes the
return values from each call to the block into a single new array, and returns
it.</p>
<p>However, if you call <span class="code">collect</span> without a block it returns an enumerator object
you can use later:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/ruby-example2.png"/>
<p>Now let’s see how Ruby implements <span class="code">Array#collect</span> internally. I’ll do this by
replacing bits of the confusing C code with Ruby, step by step. As you’ll see,
this isn’t that hard to do!</p>
<h2>rb_ary_new2 = Array.new</h2>
<p>This oddly named C function is actually quite simple: it just creates a new
Array with a length of zero, and the given “capacity.” As I explained last
week, internally Ruby saves a “capacity” value inside of each array, in the
<span class="code">RArray</span> structure, which keeps track of the size of
the memory actually allocated for the array. The confusing part of this
function is the name: <span class="code">rb_ary_new2</span> doesn’t create two
arrays, or call the “new2” method on the Array class. It’s simply equivalent to
calling <span class="code">Array.new</span> in Ruby. MRI uses the number “2” on
the function name to distinguish it from other functions that also create
arrays in slightly different ways, for example without the internal capacity
setting. Let’s take a look what <span class="code">rb_ary_new2</span> does:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/rb_ary_new2.png"/>
<p>You can see it just calls <span class="code">ary_new</span> with the given
capacity value, and by passing in <span class="code">rb_cArray</span> indicates
we want to create a new instance of the Array class (sometimes Ruby uses the
<span class="code">RArray</span> struct for instances of other classes):</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/ary_new.png"/>
<p>I won’t explain this in detail, but you can see at the top Ruby checks the
capacity parameter is valid, and gets a new <span class="code">RArray</span>
struct using the <span class="code">ary_alloc</span> function. Finally it sets
up this new <span class="code">RArray</span> if necessary. I’ll explain the
details around <span class="code">RARRAY_EMBED_LEN_MAX</span> in my next post.</p>
<p>Now let’s return to <span class="code">rb_ary_collect</span> and substitute the
Ruby <span class="code">Array.new</span> call into our C code - just as a
thought experiment, of course!</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/substitute1.png"/>
<h2>for-loop = Array#each</h2>
<p>Next, let’s look at how Ruby internally iterates over the array’s elements:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/for-loop.png"/>
<p>Of course, in Ruby I would never use a for-loop like this; instead I would
call <span class="code">Array.each</span> and pass each element to a block. But remember in the C
language there is no concept of blocks or enumerators. Instead, you have to
code “closer to the metal” and explain to the C compiler exactly how it should
iterate through the array. Here’s how this works: first the code above creates
a loop and assigns the values 0, 1, 2… to the variable <span
  class="code">i</span>. Next, Ruby accesses each value of the array using this
syntax:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/c-array.png"/>
<p>As I explained last week, the <span class="code">RARRAY_PTR</span> returns a
pointer to the array’s actual data, and <span class="code">[i]</span> uses C’s
array syntax to obtain the proper element of the array.</p>
<p>Now in our thought experiment if we substitute the for-loop with a call to
<span class="code">Array#each</span>, passing a block parameter we get:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/substitute2.png"/>
<p>Now this C code is starting to make more sense!</p>
<h2>rb_yield = yield</h2>
<p>Now let’s take a look at what happens inside the loop. As you can see, Ruby
takes each element of the array and passes it to a C function called <span
  class="code">rb_yield</span>. As you might guess, this is Ruby’s internal
implementation of the Ruby <span class="code">yield</span> keyword. I don’t
have time or space today to explain how <span class="code">rb_yield</span>
works in detail here - it calls into the internal guts of the YARV virtual
machine that runs your Ruby program. For a good explanation of how YARV works
and of what Ruby does internally when you call a block, check out chapters 2
and 5 from <a href="https://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope">Ruby Under a
Microscope</a>, my eBook on
Ruby internals.</p>
<p>Let’s continue the thought experiment and substitute <span
  class="code">rb_yield</span> with a simple Ruby <span
  class="code">yield</span> keyword:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/substitute3.png"/>
<h2>rb_ary_push = Array#&lt;&lt;</h2>
<p>Next, let’s take a look at the <span class="code">rb_ary_push</span> function call. As you might guess,
this simply calls <span class="code">Array#&lt;&lt;</span>. It adds a new value to the end of the
array. Let’s take a quick look at the implementation of this, much farther
above in the same array.c MRI source code file:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/rb_ary_push.png"/>
<p>I won’t explain this code carefully, but in a nutshell Ruby uses another C
function called <span class="code">rb_ary_push_1</span> as a optimization when
you push a single new element. The related <span class="code">Array#push</span>
method can possibly take more than one parameter, so it’s handled slightly
differently inside of MRI.</p>
<p>An interesting detail here how Ruby doubles the internal capacity of the array
when there’s no room for another value, based on the “capacity” value. This is
an optimization to avoid calling <span class="code">malloc</span> to allocate
memory over and over again as you push elements onto the array. Allocating (or
reallocating) memory can often be an expensive operation.</p>
<p>Following the same pattern, I’ll substitute a call to <span
  class="code">Array#&lt;&lt;</span> into my original C function - now the C
code is looking more and more like the Rubinius implementation:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/substitute4.png"/>
<h2>RETURN_ENUMERATOR = Kernel.to_enum</h2>
<p>As you can see, there’s just one last bit of confusing C code left from the
original version of <span class="code">rb_ary_collect</span> - the <span
  class="code">RETURN_ENUMERATOR</span> macro. Let’s take a look at how this
macro is written, from include/ruby/intern.h:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/return_enumerator.png"/>
<p>Ah yes… typical C verbosity! We have a multiline macro with backslashes, and a
needless do...while loop inserted around the actual macro to provide a safe
scope for substitution.   What in the world does this mean?</p>
<p>Don’t panic! This code isn’t that hard to understand if you take a moment to
read it carefully; it essentially means: if a block was not given then call the
<span class="code">rb_enumeratorize</span> function, passing in the name of the
current C function as a parameter. Then return the result as the return value
for <span class="code">rb_ary_collect</span>.</p>
<p>Ruby uses this <span class="code">RETURN_ENUMERATOR</span> macro quite often
while implementing methods related to enumeration, such as <span
  class="code">collect</span> or <span class="code">each</span>. You can find
the <span class="code">rb_enumeratorize</span> function in the enumerator.c MRI
source code file, but I won’t explain it here. There’s some complex code that
eventually does the same thing a call to <span
  class="code">Kernel.to_enum</span> does - which is to return a new enumerator
object that is initialized with the values in the current array.</p>
<p>Replacing this macro with the equivalent call to <span
  class="code">Kernel.to_enum</span>, I get:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/substitute5.png"/>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let’s take a step back and review what I’ve done in this odd thought
experiment. Reading the original implementation of <span
  class="code">rb_ary_collect</span> I recognized some idiomatic C patterns
that I was familiar with. This allowed me - in my own head at least - to read
the C source code the same way I would read a Ruby function. Notice how similar
the code above is to Rubinius’s implementation:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2013/1/31/rubinius2.png"/>
<p>My point today is that by learning a few of the C coding patterns the Ruby core
team uses, you can start to read Ruby’s source code just as easily as you can
read your own Ruby code. This is especially true for Ruby’s implementation of
built-in methods like <span class="code">Array#collect</span>.</p>
