<p><a href="https://twitter.com/fxn">Xavier Noria</a> (pronounced “sha - vee - aay “ in
Catalan) is very well known in the Ruby community. A self-employed Ruby
developer from Barcelona, he’s also a member of the Rails core team and won the
<a href="http://rubyheroes.com">Ruby Hero</a> award during <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010">RailsConf
2010</a>. Many of you may have met him in person;
he has presented at numerous Ruby conferences all across Europe this year.</p>
<p>But I’m most impressed by Xavier’s role as the “Code Gardener” - a phrase I
took from a <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/fb6b80562041e8d2378cad1b51f8c234fe76fd5e">minor Rails commit</a>
he made over two years ago. You can read more about this commit in an <a href="https://patshaughnessy.net/2011/12/6/learning-from-the-masters-some-of-my-favorite-rails-commits">article
I wrote last year</a>
about my favorite Rails commits. Last week Xavier and I had a chance to talk
for over an hour - <a href="http://rubysource.com/xavier-noria-the-code-gardener/">read the interview on
RubySource.com</a> to learn
more about his background, what’s coming in Rails 4, his passion for
documentation and most importantly his philosophy about the importance of small
changes. I also got a chance to ask Xavier about how you can determine if a
number is prime using a regular expression!</p>
