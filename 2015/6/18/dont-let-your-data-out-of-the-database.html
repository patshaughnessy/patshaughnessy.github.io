  <i>Don’t let your data escape from your database<br/>
  and cause unintended performance mistakes.</i>
</div>


<p>Keep your data in the database, not for security reasons but to avoid
performance mistakes. Often the best way to speed up your application is to let
your database server do what it was designed to do: operate on data.</p>

<p>Most modern programming languages and frameworks hide databases behind an
elegant, beautiful layer of abstraction. Developers today don’t need to write
or even understand Structured Query Language (SQL), the native language of
database servers. We view SQL as a low-level, technical relic of 1970s Computer
Science, best left behind in academic journals and college classrooms.</p>

<p>However, not learning and thoroughly understanding SQL would be a tremendous
mistake. In fact, many data related performance problems are a result of using
a high level language, such as Ruby or Python, to work with data instead of
SQL. Keep your data where it belongs… in the database. Use your database server
to operate on your data in place, and then fetch the result your application
actually needs.</p>

<p>Let me show you what I mean with a simple example.</p>

<div style="clear: both"></div>


<h2>Posts and Comments</h2>

<p>Suppose I have data in a one-many relationship: one post has many comments.
Using ActiveRecord, the popular Ruby ORM, I implement a one-many association by
writing:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="class">Post</span> &lt; <span class="constant">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="constant">Base</span>
  has_many <span class="symbol">:comments</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>

<span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="class">Comment</span> &lt; <span class="constant">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="constant">Base</span>
  belongs_to <span class="symbol">:post</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>



<p>Ruby’s powerful dynamic behavior allows me to query the comments for a given
post in a very natural, human way:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
post = <span class="constant">Post</span>.find(<span class="integer">1</span>)
post.comments
</pre></div>
</div>



<p>But remember ActiveRecord isn’t a magic framework. It doesn’t have a secret
connection to the tables in my database. It has to speak to the database server
like everyone else, using the server’s language: SQL. Reading my log file, I
can see how ActiveRecord translates <span class="code">post.comments</span> into SQL:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="class">select</span> comments.* <span class="keyword">from</span> comments <span class="keyword">where</span> comments.post_id = <span class="integer">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>



<p>After executing this SQL statement, ActiveRecord converts the result set into
an array of Ruby objects which I can then use in my code. For example, if I
want the latest comment for a post I can write:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="class">Post</span>
  <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="function">latest_comment</span>
    comments.max {|a, b| a.updated_at &lt;=&gt; b.updated_at }
  <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>



<p>Here I ask Ruby to sort the comment objects and return the latest one, the
comment with the maximum <span class="code">updated_at</span> value. Now I can
find the person who wrote the latest comment for a post just by writing:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
post.latest_comment.author
</pre></div>
</div>





<div style="float: right; padding: 7px 0px 50px 30px; text-align: center;">
  <img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/6/18/open-cell.jpg"><br/>
</div>


<h2>Where Is My Data?</h2>

<p>The problem with this approach is that it doesn’t scale. Suppose this post has
hundreds or even thousands of comments; in this case, ActiveRecord will convert
them all into Ruby objects just so I can iterate through them in the
<span class="code">latest_comment</span> method.</p>

<p>My mistake was to let my data out of the database. Instead, I should have asked
the database do the work for me.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at how <span class="code">latest_comment</span> works:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/6/18/filter-sort.png"/></p>

<p>On the right, I start with all of the comments in the database, tens of
thousands of them let’s say. Next, I need to search for the comments associated
with my post, filtering on the <span class="code">post_id</span> column. This
yields a subset, hundreds of comments for example. Finally, I sort these
filtered comments and take the last one, yielding the latest one on the left.</p>

<p>The problem with my Ruby solution is that I perform the filtering in the
database, but the sorting in Ruby. In between, the entire subset of comments
for a post have to be transmitted from the database server to my Ruby
application server:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/6/18/ruby-sort.png"/></p>

<p>To transmit all of these records, the database needs to serialize them to some
binary format, which my Ruby code (or my DB driver actually) later needs to
unpack. Finally, ActiveRecord has to convert this binary data into Ruby
objects.</p>

<p>This process takes time; in particular, creating hundreds or thousands of Ruby
objects involves allocating a series of memory structures and placing them into
a large array. Using a process called “garbage collection,” Ruby might even
have to find and recycle older unused Ruby objects to hold the comments, which
would take even more time.</p>

<h2>Databases Are Faster Than You Are</h2>

<p>The solution is obvious: perform the search inside the database and only return
the latest comment. But how do I ask my database server to search for the
latest comment? By using ActiveRecord methods such as <span class="code">where</span>,
<span class="code">order</span> and <span class="code">first</span> to describe
what I want, instead of writing my own code in Ruby. This line will do the
trick:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
post.comments.order(<span class="key">updated_at</span>: <span class="symbol">:desc</span>).first
</pre></div>
</div>



<p>ActiveRecord translates this into SQL code as follows:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="class">select</span> comments.* <span class="keyword">from</span> comments
<span class="keyword">where</span> comments.post_id = <span class="integer">1</span>
<span class="keyword">order</span> <span class="keyword">by</span> comments.updated_at <span class="directive">desc</span> limit <span class="integer">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>



<p>This will run much faster than my previous solution, because my database only
transmits one comment record over the network to my Ruby server: the latest
one. And Ruby only creates one Ruby object, for the latest comment:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/6/18/db-sort.png"/></p>

<p>Now highly optimized C code, running on the same server that holds the comments
table data, filters the comments by post, and sorts the matches by timestamp.
This code has been used and tested by millions of developers around the world
for years; don’t try to reinvent the wheel by rewriting the sort yourself using
Ruby.</p>

<h2>Caching the Latest Comment</h2>

<p>Suppose in my user interface I always show the author of the latest comment
next to each post. Now to display my page, I need to perform this comment
search over and over again for every post. One way to avoid the comment query
altogether would be to cache the latest comment’s author right inside the posts
table. That way I’ll get the latest comment’s author automatically when I load
the posts. No need for repeated searches, or any queries on the comments table
at all!</p>

<p>In practice, if I’ve remembered to create indexes on the <span
class="code">post_id</span> and <span class="code">updated_at</span> columns,
the comment search SQL above will run very quickly, even if I execute it many
times. I could even load the latest comments for all the posts using single SQL
query, but for the sake of argument today, let’s explore a caching solution anyway.</p>

<p>Again ActiveRecord makes this easy. All I need to do is write a migration like
this:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="class">AddLatestCommentAuthorToPosts</span> &lt; <span class="constant">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="constant">Migration</span>
  <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="function">change</span>
    add_column <span class="symbol">:posts</span>, <span class="symbol">:latest_comment_author</span>, <span class="symbol">:string</span>
  <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>



<p>Now I just need to be sure to update the post each time a user writes a new
comment:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
post.update_attribute(<span class="symbol">:latest_comment_author</span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">user name</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>)
</pre></div>
</div>



<h2>Data Migration Using Ruby</h2>

<p>Of course, I forgot something important. Using <span
class="code">update_attribute</span> I save the author for any new comments,
but what about all of the existing comments? How do I set this column’s initial
value for all the comments already in my database?</p>

<p>Simple enough: I just add a method to my migration that calls <span class="code">update_attribute</span>.
Here’s how to do it:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="class">AddLatestCommentAuthorToPosts</span> &lt; <span class="constant">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="constant">Migration</span>
  <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="function">change</span>
    add_column <span class="symbol">:posts</span>, <span class="symbol">:latest_comment_author</span>, <span class="symbol">:string</span>
    populate_latest_comment_authors
  <span class="keyword">end</span>

  <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="function">populate_latest_comment_authors</span>
   <span class="constant">Post</span>.all.each <span class="keyword">do</span> |post|
      latest_author = post.comments.order(<span class="key">updated_at</span>: <span class="symbol">:desc</span>).first.author
      post.update_attribute(<span class="symbol">:latest_comment_author</span>, latest_author)
    <span class="keyword">end</span>
  <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>



<p>Because you write migrations in Ruby, ActiveRecord makes it simple to perform
complex transformations in a simple, elegant way. Using Ruby I get all the
posts, iterate over each one, lookup the latest comment for that post, and
update the latest comment author field.</p>

<p>But I’ve made the same performance mistake as before! Looking at my Rails log
after running this migration, I find a series of repeated SQL statements:</p>

<pre>
SELECT  "comments".* FROM "comments"  WHERE "comments"."post_id" = $1  ORDER BY "comments"."updated_at" DESC LIMIT 1  [["post_id", 2]]
UPDATE "posts" SET "latest_comment_author" = $1, "updated_at" = $2 WHERE "posts"."id" = 2  [["latest_comment_author", "Harry"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-17 13:58:42.512160"]]
SELECT  "comments".* FROM "comments"  WHERE "comments"."post_id" = $1  ORDER BY "comments"."updated_at" DESC LIMIT 1  [["post_id", 3]]
UPDATE "posts" SET "latest_comment_author" = $1, "updated_at" = $2 WHERE "posts"."id" = 3  [["latest_comment_author", "Harry"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-17 13:58:42.514676"]]
SELECT  "comments".* FROM "comments"  WHERE "comments"."post_id" = $1  ORDER BY "comments"."updated_at" DESC LIMIT 1  [["post_id", 1]]
UPDATE "posts" SET "latest_comment_author" = $1, "updated_at" = $2 WHERE "posts"."id" = 1  [["latest_comment_author", "Harry"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-17 13:58:42.516071"]]
</pre>


<p>Again, I’ve let my data out of the database. By loading all of the posts using
<span class="code">Post.all</span>, and iterating over them using <span
class="code">each</span>, I’ve triggered this series of repeated SQL commands.
Now I’m transmitting all of the post data, and then more data back and forth
for each post between my database and my Ruby application:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/6/18/ruby-iterate.png"/></p>

<p>Just like my previous code, this migration will perform poorly. If I have just
a few posts it probably doesn’t matter. But imagine if there are thousands or
even 100,000s of post records: This migration might take minutes or even hours
to complete! My database server and Ruby need to serialize, transmit and
deserialize data for each one of these SQL commands.</p>

<p>There must be a better way.</p>

<h2>Data Migration Using SQL</h2>

<p>The solution is the same as before: Don’t let your data out of the database.
Instead of writing Ruby code to update each post record, ask the database
server to do it. My database server already has all my post data in an
optimized format, likely loaded into memory. It can iterate over the posts and
update them very quickly.</p>

<div style="float: right; padding: 17px 0px 10px 30px; text-align: center;">
  <img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/6/18/prison.jpg"><br/>
</div>


<p>But how? How do ask the database server to update all the posts? I need to
speak the database’s language: SQL. By writing SQL directly, I can be sure the
database is doing exactly what I want, that it’s using the most efficient
algorithm possible. I can be sure my database and I understand each other.</p>

<p>Here’s one way to update all the posts using SQL:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="class">update</span> posts <span class="class">set</span> latest_comment_author = (
  <span class="class">select</span> author <span class="keyword">from</span> comments
  <span class="keyword">where</span> comments.post_id = posts.id
  <span class="keyword">order</span> <span class="keyword">by</span> comments.updated_at <span class="directive">desc</span>
  limit <span class="integer">1</span>
)
</pre></div>
</div>



<p>This tiny SQL program actually uses SQL commands similar to the what I found
repeated in my log file. But there’s an important difference: This SQL code
doesn’t refer to hard coded post id values, such as 1 or 2. Here I’ve updated
all of the posts with a single command!</p>

<p>How does this work? Let’s take a look:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/6/18/db-iterate.png"/></p>

<p>Using a SQL migration, my Ruby code sends a single SQL command to the database
server, which is transmitted over the network to the database. Then, on the
right, my database server performs the same iteration over the posts table,
selecting the latest comment for each one.</p>

<p>This looks similar, but there’s a crucial difference: The iteration happens
entirely inside the database server. No data needs to be packed, transmitted to
the Ruby server and unpacked again. In fact, the C code performing the repeated
<span class="code">SELECT</span> statements has been compiled to native machine
language and will run very quickly. Once it fetches the latest comment, it can
directly update each post because the posts table is stored nearby on the same
server’s hard drive, or even in memory.</p>

<h2>Why Does the SQL Code Iterate?</h2>

<p>You might wonder why I drew an iteration inside the database server above.
After all, I sent the database a simple command containing 1 <span
class="code">UPDATE</span> statement and 1 <span class="code">SELECT</span>
statement. Why does my database need to execute the select over and over again?</p>

<p>The reason why is that my SQL code uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlated_subquery">correlated
subquery</a>, because the inner
<span class="code">SELECT</span> uses a value from the outer query. Here’s the
SQL again:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/6/18/correlated-subquery.png"/></p>

<p>Notice the inner <span class="code">SELECT</span> statement refers to <span
class="code">posts.id</span>, a value from the surrounding <span
class="code">UPDATE</span> statement.  This requires the database server to
iterate over all of the posts, executing the inner select for each row. I’ll
leave it as an exercise for the reader to rewrite this using an <span
class="code">UPDATE-FROM</span> statement, a <span class="code">JOIN</span> or
even Postgres window functions, which would avoid the repeated <span
class="code">SELECT</span>s.</p>

<p>However, remember if there are indexes on the columns in the comments table,
the iteration selecting the latest comment for each post will be very fast. It
will certainly be thousands of times faster than sending repeated <span
class="code">SELECT</span> and <span class="code">UPDATE</span> SQL statements
from your Ruby server over the network.</p>

<h2>Do You Need to Learn SQL?</h2>

<p>In reality I could have written this data migration using Ruby code.
ActiveRecord provides a rich set of methods, even allowing for sophisticated
queries employing subselects. And in the rare case when
ActiveRecord can’t generate the SQL I need, I can always resort to using the
underlying <a href="https://github.com/rails/arel">Arel</a> Ruby library. In practice,
it’s rare that you will actually need to write SQL code inside a Rails
application.</p>

<p>Then why learn SQL? You should learn SQL because it will give you tremendous
insight into how database servers actually work. You’ll learn what database
servers can really do, and what they can’t. You won’t try to reinvent the wheel
when you already have a server that uses algorithms more powerful and
sophisticated that any you could write.</p>

<p>Use the database server for what it was designed to do: to solve your data
problems. Whether you write SQL directly or use a tool like ActiveRecord to
generate SQL automatically, perform the search, sort, or calculation you need
right inside the database.</p>

<p>Don’t let your data out of the database until you need to… until you have just
the values your application really needs.</p>
