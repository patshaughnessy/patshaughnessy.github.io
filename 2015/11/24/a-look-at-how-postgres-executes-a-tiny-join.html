  Reading the Postgres source code is like attending a free<br/> Computer Science lecture, complete with working examples.

</div>
<p>Aside from saving and retrieving data, the primary feature of a relational
database is the ability to execute join queries, to <em>relate</em> data in one table
with data from another. While many developers are turning to NoSQL solutions,
joining one set of data values with another remains one of our most common and
important use cases while writing server code.</p>
<p>But what does the word “join” actually mean? And what really happens when I
execute a join query?  Too often we take our tools for granted, without really
understanding what they are doing. This month I decided to look at the source
code for <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>, a popular open source
database server, to see how it implements join queries.</p>
<p>Reading and experimenting with the Postgres source code turned out to be a
great learning experience. Today I’d like to report my observations; I'll
show you exactly how Postgres executed a tiny join consisting of just a few
records, using the <em>hash join</em> algorithm. In future articles I’ll show you some
interesting optimizations Postgres uses for larger joins, and other computer
science algorithms at work inside of Postgres.</p>
<h2>What is a Join?</h2>
<p>But before we get to the Postgres source code, let’s start by reviewing what
join queries are. Here's an introduction from <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/tutorial-join.html">the excellent Postgres
documentation</a>:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/postgres-join-tutorial.png"/>
<p>The Postgres docs then explain how to use joins: inner vs. outer joins, joining
a table with itself, etc. But I’m intrigued by the highlighted disclaimer.
What is that “more efficient manner?” And how could Postgres possibly get away
with not “actually comparing each possible pair of rows?”</p>
<h2>A Tiny Join</h2>
<p>As an example today let’s work with two tables: <em>publications</em>, which contains
three ground breaking computer science journal articles I never read in
college, and <em>authors</em>, which records where each author worked.</p>
<pre>> select * from publications;

                         title                          |   author   | year

<p>Today’s goal is to understand exactly what happens when Postgres joins one table with the other:</p>
<pre>> select title, company from publications, authors where author = name;

                         title                          |         company

<h2>A Conceptual Model for Joining Two Tables</h2>
<p>Before we look at the algorithm Postgres actually uses, let’s review what join
queries do conceptually. Above the documentation stated that Postgres
implements joins by “comparing each possible pair of rows,” and then selecting
“the pairs of rows where these values match.”</p>
<p>Reading this I imagine Postgres takes each publication and loops over all of
the authors, looking for that publication’s author:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/scan1.png"/>
<p>In blue on the left are the publications, and I show the author records on the
right in green. This process of iterating over the rows in the authors table is
known as a scan in the Postgres source code. We are scanning over all of the
authors for the first publication, trying to find matching names.</p>
<p>What do we do with each publication-author pair? We have to evaluate the <span
class="code">WHERE</span> clause from my example SQL statement:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/where1.png"/>
<p>Do the names match? Yes. This pair should be included in the result set. What
about the second pair?</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/where2.png"/>
<p>Do these names match? This time they don’t - this pair of rows should be
filtered out.</p>
<p>Once we have a matching pair of rows, we copy just the selected columns into a
new, joined record and return that to the client:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/select1.png"/>
<h2>A Nested Loop</h2>
<p>What’s wrong with this conceptual model? It seems like a very simple,
straightforward way of obtaining the values we need. If we proceed to scan
through the rest of the publications, it produces the same result that Postgres
does, although in a different order. (We’ll see why the order changes later.)</p>
<p>The problem is that it’s very inefficient. First we scan over all of the
authors for the first row in the publications table:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/scan1b.png"/>
<p>And then we repeat the same scan of the authors table for the second
publication:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/scan2.png"/>
<p>And again for the third row. To find all of the matching pairs, in fact, we
need to loop over all the authors for each publication:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/scan3.png"/>
<p>For my tiny query this isn’t a problem. There are 3*2 or 6 combinations of
rows; comparing names 6 times would only take a few microseconds on a modern
computer. However, as the number of rows increases in either table, the total
number of comparisons will explode. If we have 1000 publications and 1000
authors, suddenly we would have to compare name strings 1000*1000 or 1 million
times! Computer scientists describe this algorithm as O(n<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>But do we really need to search the entire authors table for each publication?
“Edgar Codd” appears in the publications table twice - why do we need to scan
the authors table for the same name more than once? After we find Edgar the
first time, there should be some way of recording where he was so we can find
him again. And even if there were no repeated author names in publications, it
still seems wasteful to loop over the authors table over and over again. There
must be some way of avoiding all of these repeated scans.</p>
<p>And there is; we can use a <em>hash table</em>.</p>
<h2>Avoiding Repeated Scans</h2>
<p>The problem with our naive algorithm, the conceptual model from the Postgres
documentation, is that we loop over the authors table over and over again. To
avoid those repeated loops, imagine if we scanned the authors only once and
then saved them in some kind of data structure:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/bag1.png"/>
<p>Now that we have the author records, what do we need to do with them? Well, we
have to scan the publications, obtain each publication’s author, and find the
matching author records, if any. In other words, we need to be able to quickly
and easily find the author record with a given name:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/bag2.png"/>
<p>You’ve probably seen this data structure before; in fact, it might be something
you use everyday in your own code. If you’re a Rubyist like me, you call this a
<em>hash</em>. If you prefer Python it’s a <em>dictionary</em>, or in Clojure it’s <em>hash map</em>.</p>
<p>With all the authors organized by their names, we can scan over the
publications and quickly find out if there’s a matching author record:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/bag3.png"/>
<p>But what are hash tables, exactly? And how do they work? If only we could go
back in time and sneak back into our college Computer Science classroom again.
But if you installed Postgres from source, using Homebrew or with some Linux
package manager, you already have an open source, world class implementation of
the hash table algorithm right on your computer! To learn more about it
all we have to do is read the Postgres source code.</p>
<h2>Calculating Hashes</h2>
<p>It turns out that for this query Postgres actually hashes the publications and
then iterates over the authors. Before starting to execute a query, Postgres
first parses the SQL we give it and generates a “query plan.” Probably because
the publications table is larger (I’m not sure), Postgres’s query planner
decides to save the publications, not the authors, in the hash table.</p>
<p>To do this, Postgres has to scan the publications just as we did above:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/scan4.png"/>
<p>And for each publication, Postgres selects just two of the three columns:
author and title. Postgres refers to the query plan and finds out it will need
the author for the <span class="code">WHERE</span> join condition, and the
title for the final <span class="code">SELECT</span> returning the result set.
It leaves the year values behind.</p>

  <img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/9/23/codd.jpg"><br/>
  <i>Edgar Codd</i>
</div>
<p>This process of selecting the desired attributes from the matching pair is
known in the Postgres C source code as a <em>projection</em>. We “project” a few values
from one set of columns to another. (The term <em>project</em> is actually much older
even than Postgres; Edgar Codd first used it in this context in <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ezives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf">A Relational
Model of Data for Large Shared Data
Banks</a> back in 1970.)</p>
<p>Next Postgres calculates a <em>hash</em> based on the author string. A hash is some
integer value that can be calculated quickly in a repeatable, reproducible way.
For the same author string, e.g. “Edgar Codd,” Postgres always calculates the
same hash number. As we’ll see in a moment, Postgres uses the hash value to
decide where to save the author name in the hash table.</p>
<p>You can find Postgres’s hash algorithm in a C file called hashfunc.c. Even if
you’re not a C developer, there are extensive code comments explaining what’s
going on, along with a link to <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html">an article written by Bob
Jenkins</a>, who developed the
algorithm in 1997.</p>

</div>
</p>
<p>In my example, Postgres passes “Edgar Codd,” the string value in the author
column in the first publication record, to <span class="code">hash_any</span>.
The complex bitwise calculations in <span class="code">hash_any</span> step
over the characters in Edgar’s name and return this hash value:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/hash1.png"/>
<h2>Using a Bitmask to Choose a Hash Bucket</h2>
<p>Now that it has a hash, what does Postgres do with it? You can see a clue above
in the C comments: </p>
<blockquote>
The best hash table sizes are powers of 2.  There is no need to do mod a prime
(mod is sooo slow!). If you need less than 32 bits, use a bitmask.
</blockquote>
<p>A hash table consists of an array of “buckets,” which are a series of pointers
to linked lists. Initially Postgres creates an empty array of bucket pointers
just before starting to scan the publications:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/buckets1.png"/>
<p>As you can guess, Postgres saves each publication in one of the buckets in the
hash table, based on the calculated hash value. Later when it scans over the
authors, it will be able to find the publications again quickly by
recalculating the same hash values. Instead of scanning over all of the
publications again, Postgres can just look up each publication’s author using
the hash. The hash is a record of where each publication is saved in the hash
table.</p>
<p>However, if two publications turn out to have the same author, as we have in
our example, then Postgres will have to save them both in the same bucket. This
is why each bucket is a linked list; each bucket has to save more than one
publication.</p>
<p>Because our example has three publications, does Postgres use a hash table with
three buckets? Or with two buckets, because of the repeated author value? No.
It actually uses 1024 buckets! Why 1024? For two reasons: First, Postgres was
designed to query large amounts of data. Its hash join algorithm was optimized
to handle extremely large data sets, containing millions of records or even
more. A table containing three records is truly tiny! Postgres doesn’t bother
with small hash tables and uses a minimum size of 1024.</p>
<p>And why a power of two? This makes it easier to decide which bucket to use for
a given hash. Instead of trying to return hash values that match the number of
buckets, it’s easier and faster to always returns very large values. What
Postgres does instead is distribute the large hash values evenly over the number
of buckets it does have. By choosing a power of two for the bucket array size,
Postgres can use a fast bitwise operation to decide which bucket to save each
publication in, like this:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/hash2.png"/>
<p>Above you can see how Postgres decides where to put “Edgar Codd” in the hash
table: It subtracts one from the number of buckets: 1024-1 = 1023. Written in
binary this is 1111111111. Then using your microprocessor’s binary computing
circuits, Postgres quickly masks out the left bits, and keeps just the 10 least
significant or rightmost bits. This yields 0000001111 binary, or the number 15.
Using this fast calculation, Postgres decides to save Edgar in bucket #15:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/buckets2.png"/>
<p>Postgres also saves the title string, because it will need it later to produce
the final result set. Along with the two strings, Postgres saves the hash value
and a “next” pointer that will form the linked list.</p>
<h2>Building the Rest of the Hash Table</h2>
<p>Postgres now continues to scan over the publications, arriving at the second
publication.</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/scan5.png"/>
<p>We have Edgar again! Clearly he was a central figure behind database theory.
Calculating the hash again for the same string will always return the same
value: 2130627599, yielding bucket #15 a second time. We know the Edgar Codd
records will always appear in bucket 15.</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/buckets3.png"/>
<p>Also notice that Postgres saves each new publication at the head of the linked
list - this means we have the second Edgar publication first on the left, and
Edgar’s first publication second on the right. As we’ll see next, this yields
the reverse order of Edgar’s records we saw above in the conceptual algorithm.</p>
<p>Finally Postgres continues scanning and saves the third publication in the hash
table; this time Postgres calculates a hash for “Jim Gray:”</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/hash3.png"/>
<p>You can see this time the 10 rightmost bits of 3344886182 evaluate to 422. So
Postgres saves Jim in bucket #422. Drawing the bucket array more to scale it
might look something like this:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/buckets4.png"/>
<h2>Scanning Buckets</h2>
<p>After saving all the publications in the hash table, Postgres can now scan over
the authors table:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/scan6.png"/>
<p>Now finding the matching publication is simple. Instead of scanning over all
the publications, Postgres simply calls the hash function again on the name
string from the authors table, and repeats the bitmask operation. Because the
first author record is Edgar, Postgres knows the matching publications will be
in bucket #15.</p>
<p>In our tiny example, the only records in bucket 15 will be for Edgar Codd. But
remember in a large SQL query there might be millions of publications. It’s
possible that publications with different authors might appear in this bucket.
This would happen because either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The hash function returned the same hash number for two different author
strings. This is possible but unlikely. In Computer Science this would be known
as a <em>hash collision</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 10 least significant bits of the hash were the same. For millions of
publications this would happen frequently. However, as the number of records in
the join increases Postgres uses more and more bits in the bitmask. 1024 (10
bits) was the minimum number it uses for our tiny query. Still, hash table
buckets in practice will contain multiple key values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, Postgres has to check each author in the matching bucket to be sure
that it’s a match. This process is known as <em>scanning the bucket</em>. To do this,
Postgres first checks the hash values:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/scan-buckets1.png"/>
<p>This is a simple numerical comparison and so is quite fast. And if the hashes
are the same, Postgres checks the actual strings just in case the hash function
did return the same hash for different strings:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/scan-buckets2.png"/>
<p>Because the author names match, Postgres can finally perform the join!  To do
this, it projects the columns that our query selects into a single joined
record, in the desired order:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/select2.png"/>
<p>This becomes the first record in our result set.</p>
<h2>Returning Multiple Records: The Hash Join State Machine</h2>
<p>One of the most beautiful and important aspects of the Postgres implementation
is the way it orchestrates building up and searching the hash table in the
midst of a larger enclosing SQL expression. To see this for yourself, take a
look at the hash join implementation, in nodeHashJoin.c.</p>
<p>
<div class="sign">
  <div class="sign-icon"></div>
  <div class="function-info">
    <div class="function-name">ExecHashJoin</div>
    <div class="function-link"><a href="http://doxygen.postgresql.org/nodeHashjoin_8c.html#a538698b031186193de7da58537820e61">view on postgresql.org</a></div>
  </div>
  <div class="function-code">
    <img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/ExecHashJoin.png"/>
  </div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Postgres calls <span class="code">ExecHashJoin</span> once for each record in the join result set. For
our example with 3 result records Postgres calls <span class="code">ExecHashJoin</span> three times.
<span class="code">ExecHashJoin</span> keeps track of how many times it has been called, and what it
needs to do next, using a state machine.</p>
<p>The best way to understand how this state machine works, and how it fits into
the larger structure of Postgres’s architecture, is to imagine that we asked
for one record at a time. For example, imagine that we select just a single
record from the join:</p>
<pre>select title, company from publications, authors where author = name limit 1</pre>
<p>By appending <span class="code">limit 1</span> we tell Postgres to stop after 1
record. For this query, to return just one record, <span class="code">ExecHashJoin</span> will use the
following states in its state machine:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/states1.png"/>
<p>Here’s what <span class="code">ExecHashJoin</span> does to obtain the first joined record:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="code">HJ_BUILD_HASHTABLE</span>: This code builds the hash table by scanning over all
the publications records, as we saw above. Postgres calls publications the
“inner relation.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="code">HJ_NEED_NEW_OUTER</span>: This code starts scanning the “outer relation” or the
authors table in this example, and returns a single record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="code">HJ_SCAN_BUCKET</span>: This code takes one outer relation record (an author) and
looks for the matching inner relation records in the hash table (publications).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now imagine that I ask Postgres for two records, by using limit 2:</p>
<pre>select title, company from publications, authors where author = name limit 2</pre>
<p>The second time Postgres calls <span class="code">ExecHashJoin</span>, it only
executes <span class="code">HJ_NEED_NEW_OUTER</span> and <span
class="code">HJ_SCAN_BUCKET</span> - it already created the hash table the
first time it was called:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2015/11/24/states2.png"/>
<p>Postgres pays the large price of scanning the entire inner relation and
building the hash table as soon as you ask for one record. Returning the second
and all subsequent records is much faster because Postgres already has the hash
table.</p>
<p>If you read the C code you’ll see some interesting optimizations. For example,
Postgres actually scans the outer relation first to get a single record, just
in case it might be empty. (This is what the C comment above refers to.)
There’s no need to build a hash table if we’re not going to look up any values!
Also, the <span class="code">HJ_FILL_INNER</span> and <span
class="code">HJ_FILL_OUTER</span> states handle executing right
or left outer joins respectively. <span class="code">ExecHashJoin</span>
implements these as well.</p>
<p>By using a state machine like this Postgres can execute this join inside the
context of a large, complex SQL statement. It could be that we are joining
together result sets from complex inner SQL clauses, or that the result set
from this join becomes part of a larger expression. The state inside of <span
class="code">ExecHashJoin</span> allows Postgres to keep track of what is was
doing - and of what it needs to do next - in the appropriate place on the
execution stack.</p>
<h2>What’s Next?</h2>
<p>The last state value handled by <span class="code">ExecHashJoin</span>,
HJ_NEED_NEW_BATCH, handles the case where the hash table doesn’t fit into
the server’s memory. In this case, Postgres will create a series of hash tables
and save some of them out to disk in “batch files.” This algorithm is what the term
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_join">Hybrid Hashjoin</a> refers to.</p>
<p>When I have time, I’d love to write about how Postgres handles a large join
instead of a tiny one: How do batch files work? What configuration settings
have an effect on batch files and join performance? And there’s also an
interesting optimization Postgres uses for frequently occurring join key
values.</p>
<p>Postgres does some amazing things internally to speed up your queries; it’s
time to shed some light on the great work the Postgres open source community
has done over the years!</p>
