    multiplies large integers using the same<br/> algorithm we learned in
    elementary school.</i> </div>
<p>Imagine yourself as an 8 or 9 year old at a chalkboard learning to multiply.
Your teacher asks you to write one number over another, and then to draw an “x”
and a line below. Next you multiply the numbers one digit at a time, using the
multiplication table you memorized the year before. Your teacher also shows you
how to “carry” values from one column to the next when they don’t fit as a
single digit.</p>
<p>After studying Ruby’s multiplication algorithm, I was surprised to find out
that Ruby multiplies large numbers (<span class="code">Bignum</span>’s) the
same way you learned in fourth grade: one “digit” at a time. My post today will
give you a quick refresher course on fourth grade math, and then explain how
Ruby’s <span class="code">Bignum</span> class uses the same classic, long
multiplication algorithm you learned in elementary school!</p>
<h2>A Crash Course in Fourth Grade Math</h2>
<p>We all remember multiplication tables: memorizing them was either a fun mental
exercise - or a painful form of torture - depending on our mathematical
aptitude and the personality of our grade school teacher. Regardless, there
were two reasons for memorizing simple products such as 5 x 6 = 30 or 9 x 7 =
63.  First, these simple problems occur frequently; and second, they help us
later when multiplying larger numbers.</p>
<p>Maybe you flunked out of school before the fourth grade, or more likely you’ve
become so dependent on your iPhone’s calculator app you don’t remember how to
multiply by hand. Before we look at how Ruby multiplies numbers, let’s review
the classic long multiplication algorithm.</p>
<p>Here’s a sample problem:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/sample.png"><br/></p>
<p>Now walk up to the chalkboard and write the two numbers one above the other,
the larger number on top:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/sample2.png"><br/></p>
<div style="float: right; padding: 7px 0px 40px 30px; text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/mult-tables.jpg"><br/>
</div>
<p>Remember what to do next? For me fourth grade was in the 1970s, but somehow it
still comes back to me! Start by multiplying the rightmost digits from each
number together (2 x 9 = 18), placing the product below the line:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/sample3.png"><br/></p>
<p>However, since 18 is too large to fit into a single digit you “carry” the 1 up
to the top of the next column, and leave the 8 behind:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/sample4.png"><br/></p>
<p>Next multiply 9 again by the next digit from the top number, 3 in this example,
adding  the 1 you carried from the last step. So you calculate (9x3)+1 = 28.</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/sample5.png"><br/></p>
<p>Here I’ve written the 28 below the line, to the left of the previous 8 value.
So far you’ve calculated that 9x32 = 288.</p>
<p>Remember what to do next? I know it’s been a long time! Repeat the process with
the next digit from the lower number, 2. In other words, you calculate 2x32=64.
However, this time you write the product farther below, shifted to the left
like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/sample6.png"><br/></p>
<p>You shift the numbers to the left because the 2 from 29 is actually a 20. Now
all you need to do is add the two intermediate products together, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/sample7.png"><br/></p>
<p>Drop the first 8 down, add 8+4=12, carry the 1 and finally calculate 1+2+6 = 9.
You have the answer, 928. Congratulations, you’ve managed to multiply two
numbers by hand without a calculator!</p>
<h2>Ruby’s Multiplication Table</h2>

  <i>The Intel 4004 was the first<br/>
    commercially available microprocessor<br/>(source: <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Intel_4004.jpg">wikimedia commons</a>)</i>
</div>
<p>To multiply small numbers Ruby doesn’t implement a software algorithm. Instead,
Ruby relies on your computer’s microprocessor’s hardware circuits to perform
the calculation. Your microprocessor, in a sense, plays the role of a
multiplication table for Ruby. By using a machine language instruction to
multiply numbers, Ruby can get simple products very quickly. This is loosely
analogous to you or I memorizing the simple products from the multiplication
table in our heads.</p>
<p>As I discussed in <a href="https://patshaughnessy.net/2014/1/9/how-big-is-a-bignum">my last article</a>, Ruby stores small integers as native 64-bit
values using the <span class="code">Fixnum</span> class. For example, in Ruby we could multiply two
numbers like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/five-six-ruby.png"><br/></p>
<p>When you execute this program, Ruby’s internal C code represents these two
numbers as <span class="code">Fixnum</span> objects:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/fixnums.png"><br/></p>
<p>As you can see, Ruby represents each <span class="code">Fixnum</span> with a 64-bit binary value with the
least significant bit (FIXNUM_FLAG) set. When it needs to multiply, Ruby first removes the FIXNUM_FLAG bit and is
left with the actual binary values 5 and 6. Now it can perform the
multiplication using a native machine language instruction.</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/fixnums-multiply.png"><br/></p>
<p>Above <span class="code">imulq</span> is the Intel x86-64 assembly language
instruction for multiplying integers. Ruby relies on the microprocessor to
calculate 5x6 and to return the product 30, shown as binary at the bottom.</p>
<h2>A Fourth Grader That Knows Hexadecimal</h2>
<p>Ruby multiplies large numbers exactly the same way you and I do, using the
classic long multiplication algorithm. We use long multiplication to multiply
numbers larger than 12, since the multiplication tables we memorized went up to
12. Ruby uses long multiplication for numbers that don’t fit into a <span class="code">Fixnum</span>
object - numbers so large that a single machine language instruction can’t
process them.</p>
<p>Here’s an example problem:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/hex-sample1.png"><br/></p>
<p>The number 29 fits into a <span class="code">Fixnum</span> no problem, but 10000000000000000000 does not.
Instead, Ruby represents this large integer using a <span class="code">Bignum</span> object, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/bignum.png"><br/></p>
<p>You can see a simplified view of the <span class="code">RBignum</span> C structure at the top. The <span class="code">digits</span>
pointer saves the location of an array of 32-bit values, the “digits.” As I
explained in <a href="https://patshaughnessy.net/2014/1/9/how-big-is-a-bignum">my last article</a>, the digits are actually out of order, with the
lower 32 bits on the left and the top 32 bits on the right.</p>
<p>Since Ruby represents <span class="code">Bignum</span>’s with a complex data structure and not simple
64-bit integers, it can’t use machine language instructions to perform
mathematical operations on them. What does Ruby do instead? How did it
calculate 10000000000000000000 * 29 above?</p>
<p>It turns out Ruby uses long multiplication, just as we did in fourth grade! The
only difference is that Ruby uses 32-bit “digits,” instead of digits that
contain decimal values from 0-9.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, here’s another look at the 32x29 problem we did earlier:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/another-look.png"><br/></p>
<p>Above I show a rectangle around each 0-9 decimal digit. Remember the long
multiplication algorithm works on one pair of digits at a time. The 0-9
notation means that each digit can hold a value between 0 and 9.</p>
<p>Now let’s take another look at the large integer multiplication Ruby executed
above:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/hex-sample2.png"><br/></p>
<p>If I redraw this using 32-bit “digits,” I get this:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/hex-sample3.png"><br/></p>
<p>Each rectangle is a 32-bit word present in a <span class="code">Bignum</span> <span class="code">digit</span> data structure. At the bottom
we see 0x1d, which is 29. (This does fit into a <span class="code">Fixnum</span> but Ruby moves it to a <span class="code">Bignum</span> before the multiplication starts.) Above that are the bits from the <span class="code">RBignum</span> structure, shown in the proper order. 0x8ac72304 are the most significant 32 bits
and 0x89e80000 are the least significant 32 bits. In order words, the
hexadecimal value 0x8ac7230489e80000 is equivalent to 10000000000000000000.</p>
<p>It might seem bizarre to show a multiplication problem this way, but remember
Ruby is a  very special fourth grader, one that knows how to perform binary
math and can understand hexadecimal.</p>
<h2>Multiplying Bignums Using Long Multiplication</h2>
<p>Once we’ve drawn the problem using 32-bit hexadecimal digits, we’ll be able to
see that Ruby performs long multiplication just like you or I did back in school.
First, it multiplies the rightmost digits from each number.</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/hex-sample4.png"><br/></p>
<p>So we have 0x89e80000 * 0x1d = 0xf9f480000. But now the top 4 bits, the 0xf,
doesn’t fit into a single 32-bit value. So Ruby “carries” the 0xf to the next
column.</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/hex-sample5.png"><br/></p>
<p>You can see above the carried value 0xf at the top left, and the remaining bits
in the 32-bit digit at the bottom right.</p>
<p>Now Ruby calculates 0x8ac72304 * 0x1d + 0xf and gets 0xfb88ef783.</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/hex-sample6.png"><br/></p>
<p>Once again, 0xfb88ef783 doesn’t fit into 32 bits, so Ruby carries the extra 0xf
to the next column. Since this was the last column, Ruby is done and just moves
the extra 0xf into a new 32-bit digit:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/hex-sample7.png"><br/></p>
<p>And now we have our answer:</p>
<p><img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/24/hex-sample8.png"><br/></p>
<h2>Multiplication of Extremely Large Numbers</h2>
<p>This was a very simple example, because 29 was actually a small integer. This
meant Ruby didn’t need to use multiple rows in the long multiplication process,
adding them together to get the final result. But Ruby would use multiple rows in
long multiplication just the way we would if both numbers were large.</p>
<p>However, Ruby’s <span class="code">Bignum</span> class was also designed to handle extremely large numbers
that might contain thousands of digits. You might need these for certain
scientific applications or in cryptography, for example. To handle extremely
large numbers, the <span class="code">Bignum</span> class also contains some alternative, advanced
mathematical algorithms for multiplication, division and more. Ruby 2.1 also now optionally supports the GMP, the <a href="https://gmplib.org">GNU
Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library</a>. In my next post I’ll take a look at how
to enable GMP support and how to use it.</p>
