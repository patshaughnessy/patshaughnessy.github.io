    <i>The time sheets I used at my first programming<br/>
    job in the Summer of 1986 looked just like this.</i>
</div>


<p>Recently I’ve been spending some of my free time studying Clojure and Haskell.
I’ve been learning how a program built with a series of small, pure functions
can be very robust and maintainable. However, I don’t want to give up on Ruby.
I want to keep the expressiveness, beauty and readability of Ruby, while
writing simple functions with no side effects.</p>

<p>But how can this be possible? Unlike functional languages, Ruby encourages you
to hide state inside of objects, and to write functions (methods) that have
side effects, modifying an instance variable for example. Isn’t using an object
oriented language like Ruby, Python, or Java a decision to abandon the benefits
of functional programming?</p>

<p>No. In fact, a couple of weeks ago Ruby’s object model helped me refactor one
confusing function into a series of small simple ones. Today I’ll show you what
happened, how using a Ruby class helped me write more functional code.</p>

<div style="clear: left"/></div>


<h2>Parsing Timesheet Data</h2>

<p>Let’s suppose you are a ScrumMaster&trade; and want to make sure your team of
developers, including me, is putting in enough hours on your project (instead
of taking long lunches or writing blog posts). For example, suppose I report my
hours like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/timesheet-data.png"><br/></p>

<p>You could parse my timesheet data using this simple Ruby program:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/parse1.png"><br/></p>

<p>This is simple enough to understand and works fine. <span
class="code">parse1</span> is small function; if you remove the calls to <span class="code">puts</span>
it only contains 3 lines of code, two simple calls to <span class="code">split</span>. How could this be
any simpler?</p>

<h2>A First Pass at a Functional Solution</h2>

<p>Next you decide to look for a more functional solution by <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2014/2/10/use-an-ask-dont-tell-policy-with-ruby">asking Ruby for what
you want, instead of telling it what to
do</a>.
You try to break the problem up into small functions that return what you need.
But what functions should you write? What values should they return? In this
simple example, the answer is obvious: you can write a function to parse each
value in the timesheet data.</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/asking.png"><br/></p>

<p>You have divided the problem up into small pieces. Each function will return a
predictable value based on some input and doesn’t have any side effects. These
will be <em>pure</em> functions: They will always return the same result given the same
arguments. You know that if you pass a line from my timesheet, <span
  class="code">last_name</span> will always return “Shaughnessy.” You’ve turned
the problem around; you’ve phrased the problem as a series of questions rather
than as a list of instructions.</p>

<p>Refactoring <span class="code">parse1</span> above, you implement the
functions, at least in a somewhat verbose and ugly fashion:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/refactoring.png"><br/></p>

<h2>Testing Pure Functions</h2>

<p>As a Certified ScrumMaster&trade;, you believe in TDD and other extreme
programming practices. Originally, while writing <span
  class="code">parse1</span> above, it didn’t even occur to you to write tests
(and if it had, it would have been very difficult).  However, now after
breaking the problem up into a series of functions, it seems natural to write
tests for them.</p>

<p>Next, you express your expectations for these functions using Minitest specs,
for example:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/spec.png"><br/></p>

<p>Because the functions are small, the tests are small. Because the tests are
small, you actually take the time to write them. Because the functions are
decoupled from each other, it’s easy for you to decide which tests to write.</p>

<p>To your surprise, you actually find a bug!</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/spec-fails.png"><br/></p>

<p>Earlier in <span class="code">parse1</span>, the extra space was lost in the
<span class="code">puts</span> output and you didn’t notice it. Separating this into a small function and
carefully testing it revealed a minor problem. You adjust two of the functions
to remove the extra space:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/fixing-bug.png"><br/></p>

<h2>Pushing Ruby Out Of Its Comfort Zone</h2>

<p>You’re happy with your new tests. Ruby allowed you describe the behavior of the
functions in a very natural, readable way. Ruby at its best. As an added bonus,
the tests now also pass!</p>

<p>However, your functions aren’t so pretty. There is a lot of obvious
duplication: The <span class="code">office</span>, <span
  class="code">employee_id</span> and <span class="code">last_name</span>
functions all call <span class="code">line.split(&#39;,&#39;)</span>. To fix this, you
decide to extract <span class="code">line.split(&#39;,&#39;)</span> into a separate
function, removing the duplication:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/extracting-method.png"><br/></p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t look any better; in fact, there’s a deeper problem here. To see
what I mean let’s refactor <span class="code">parse1</span> from earlier to use
our new functions:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/parse2.png"><br/></p>

<p>This is clean and easy to follow, but now you have a performance bug: Each time
around the loop, your code passes the same line to <span
class="code">employee_id</span>, <span class="code">office</span> and <span
class="code">last_name</span>. Now Ruby will call the <span class="code">values</span> function over and
over again. This is unnecessary and needless; in fact, our original <span
  class="code">parse1</span> code didn’t have this problem. By introducing
functions we have slowed down our code.</p>

<p>However, because these are simple, pure functions, you know they will always
return the same value given the same input argument, the same line of text in
this example. This means theoretically you can avoid calling <span
class="code">split</span> over and over again by caching the results.</p>

<p>At first, you try to cache the return value of <span class="code">split</span>
by using a hash table like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/hash1.png"><br/></p>

<p>This looks straightforward: The keys in <span class="code">split_lines</span>
are the lines and the values are the corresponding split lines. You use Ruby’s
elegant <span class="code">||=</span> operator either to return a cached value
from the hash or actually call <span class="code">split</span>, updating the
hash.</p>

<p>The only problem with this is that it doesn’t work. The code inside of the
<span class="code">values</span> function can’t access the <span
class="code">split_lines</span> hash, located outside the method.  And if you
move <span class="code">split_lines</span> inside of <span class="code">values</span>, it would become a
local variable and not retain values across method calls.</p>

<p>To work around this problem you could pass the cache as an additional argument
to <span class="code">values</span>, but this would make your program even more
verbose than it is now.  Or you could create the <span
class="code">values</span> method using <span
class="code">define_method</span>, instead of <span class="code">def</span>,
like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/hash2.png"><br/></p>

<p>This confusing Ruby syntax allows the code inside of the new <span class="code">values</span> method to
access the surrounding scope, including the hash table.</p>

<p>However, taking a step back, something about your program now feels wrong.</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/step-back.png"><br/></p>

<p>Instead of making your code simpler and easier to understand, functional
programming has started to make your Ruby code more confusing and harder to
read. You’ve introduced a new data structure to cache results, and resorted to
confusing metaprogramming to make it work. And your functions are still quite
repetitive.</p>

<p>What’s gone wrong? Possibly Ruby isn’t the right language to use with
functional programming.</p>

<h2>Introducing a Ruby Class</h2>

<p>Next, you decide to forget all about functional programming and to try again by
using a Ruby class. You write a <span class="code">Line</span> class,
representing a single line of text from the timesheet text file:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/line1.png"><br/></p>

<p>And you decide to move your functions into the new <span class="code">Line</span> class:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/line2.png"><br/></p>

<p>Now you have a lot less noise. The biggest improvement is that now there’s no
need to pass the line of text around as a parameter to each function. Instead,
you hide it away in an instance variable, making the code much easier to read.
Also, your functions have become methods. Now you know all the functions
related to parsing lines are in the <span class="code">Line</span> class. You
know where to find them, and more or less what they are for. Ruby has helped
you organize your code using a class, which is really just a collection of
functions.</p>

<p>Continuing to simplify, you refactor the <span class="code">value</span> method at the bottom to remove
the confusing <span class="code">define_method</span> syntax:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/refactor-values.png"><br/></p>

<p>Now each instance of the <span class="code">Line</span> class, each line of text you program uses, will
have its own copy of <span class="code">@values</span>. By using a Ruby class, you don’t need to
resort to a hash table to map between lines (keys) and split lines (values).
Instead you employ a very common Ruby idiom, combining an instance variable
<span class="code">@values</span>, with the <span class="code">||=</span>
operator. Instance variables are the perfect place to cache information such as
method return values.</p>

<h2>Breaking All the Rules</h2>

<p>Now your code is much easier to read. Using an object oriented instead of a
functional design turned out to be a good idea.</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/line3.png"><br/></p>

<p>With your object oriented solution, you have broken some of the most important
rules of functional programming: First, you created hidden state, the <span
class="code">@line</span> instance variable, wrapping it up and hiding it
inside the <span class="code">Line</span> class. The <span class="code">@values</span> instance
variable holds even more state information. And second, the <span class="code">initialize</span> and
<span class="code">values</span> methods have side effects: They change the value of <span
class="code">@line</span> and <span class="code">@values</span>. Finally,
all the other methods of <span class="code">Line</span> are no longer pure functions! They return values
that depend on state located outside of each function: the <span
class="code">@line</span> variable. In fact, they can return different values
even though they take no arguments at all.</p>

<p>But I believe these are technicalities. You haven’t lost the benefits of
functional programming with this refactoring. While the methods of <span
  class="code">Line</span> depend on external state (<span
  class="code">@line</span> and <span class="code">@values</span>), that state
  isn’t located very far away. It’s still easy to predict, understand and test
  what these small functions do. Also, while <span class="code">@line</span> is
  technically a mutable string that you change in your program, in practice it
  isn’t. You set it once using <span class="code">initialize</span> and then
  never change it again. While you may update <span class="code">@values</span>
  each time <span class="code">values</span> is called, it&rsquo;s just a performance
  optimization. It doesn’t change the overall behavior of values.</p>

<p>You’ve broken the rules and rewritten your pure, functional program is a more
idiomatic, Ruby manner. However, you haven’t lost the spirit of functional
programming. Your code is just as easy to understand, maintain and test.</p>

<h2>Creating an Object Pipeline</h2>

<p>Wrapping up, you refactor your original program to use your new <span
class="code">Line</span> class like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/parse3.png"><br/></p>

<p>Of course, there’s not much difference here. You simply added a line of code to
create new line objects, and then called its methods instead of your original
functions.</p>

<p>Finally, you decide to take one step further and refactor again by mapping the
array of text lines to an array of line objects:</p>

<p><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/object-pipeline.png"><br/></p>

<div style="float: right; padding: 80px 0px 25px 20px; text-align: center;">
  <img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/4/8/factory.jpg"><br/>
</div>


<p>Again, not much difference in the code. However, the way you think about your
program has changed dramatically. Now your code implements a pipeline of sorts,
passing data through a series of operations or transformations. You start with
an array of text lines from a file, convert them into an array of Ruby objects,
and finally process each object using your parse functions.</p>

<p>This pattern of passing data through a series of operations is common in
languages such as Haskell and Clojure. What’s interesting here is how Ruby
objects are the perfect target for these operations. You’ve used a Ruby class
to implement a functional programming pattern.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> <a href="https://twitter.com/orend">Oren Dobzinski</a> suggested adding a
<span class="code">to_s</span> method to <span class="code">Line</span>, which
would allow us to push the object pipeline idea even further. Thanks Oren! See
