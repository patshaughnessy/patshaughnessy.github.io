<b>I’m happy to announce _Ruby Under a Microscope_ is now available in print!</b>

_Ruby Under a Microscope_ gives you a hands-on look at Ruby’s core, using
extensive diagrams and thorough explanations to show you how Ruby is
implemented (no C skills required). I take a scientific approach, laying out a
series of experiments with Ruby code to take you behind the scenes of how
programming languages work. You’ll even find information on JRuby and Rubinius
(two alternative implementations of Ruby), as well as in-depth explorations of
Ruby’s garbage collection algorithm.

_Ruby Under a Microscope_ will teach you:

* How a few computer science concepts underpin Ruby’s complex implementation
* How Ruby executes your code using a virtual machine
* How classes and modules are the same inside Ruby
* How Ruby employs algorithms originally developed for Lisp
* How Ruby uses grammar rules to parse and understand your code
* How your Ruby code is translated into a different language by a compiler.

No programming language needs to be a black box. Whether you’re already
intrigued by language implementation or just want to dig deeper into Ruby,
you’ll find _Ruby Under a Microscope_ a fascinating way to become a better
programmer.

## What’s New in the Expanded Book?

Professionally edited and produced, the expanded book covers important new
features introduced with Ruby 2.0: <span class="code">Module#prepend</span>,
keyword arguments, refinements and more. You’ll learn how to use them… and even
how Ruby 2.0 implements them internally! I also updated the text and diagrams
from my 2012 eBook to account for important changes to Ruby's virtual machine
(YARV) made during 2.0 release, and added new chapters covering JRuby, Rubinius
and garbage collection.

I had the honor of working with [Aaron “tenderlove”
Patterson](https://twitter.com/tenderlove) on the project, who was the
technical reviewer.  Thanks to Aaron, the expanded book is both more accurate and
more interesting: Aaron had a number of great suggestions for new content which
I included as well.

## A Free Chapter Online

No Starch has posted Chapter 6, “Module Lookup and Constant Lookup,” as a [free
online PDF](http://nostarch.com/download/samples/RUM_CH6_excerpt.pdf). It
discusses how internally Ruby implements modules as classes, how Ruby finds
methods you call, and how Ruby uses lexical scope to find constants.
