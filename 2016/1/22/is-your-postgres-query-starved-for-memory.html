Like a patient with low blood pressure, a slow SQL<br/>
query might not be getting the memory it needs.
  </i>
</div>
<p>For years or even decades, I’ve heard about how important it is to optimize my
SQL statements and database schema. When my application starts to
slow down, I look for missing indexes; I look for unnecessary joins; I think
about caching results with a materialized view.</p>
<p>But instead, the problem might be my Postgres server was not installed and
tuned properly. Buried inside the <span class="code">postgresql.conf</span>
file is an obscure, technical setting called <span
class="code">work_mem</span>. This controls how much “working memory” your
Postgres server allocates for each sort or join operation. The default value
for this is only 4MB:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2016/1/22/work_mem.png"/>
<div style="clear: left"></div>
<p>If your application ever tries to sort or join more than four megabytes worth
of data, this working memory buffer will fill up. Instead of just returning the
dataset you want, Postgres will waste time streaming excess data out to disk -
only to read it back again later as the hash join or sort algorithm proceeds.</p>
<p>Today I’ll start with a look at how Postgres scales up the hash join algorithm
for larger and larger data sets. Then I’ll measure how much slower a hash join
query is when the hash table doesn’t fit into the working memory buffer. You’ll
learn how to use the EXPLAIN ANALYZE command to find out if your slow query is
starved for memory.</p>
<h2>Hash Tables Inside of Postgres</h2>
<p>In my last article, I described <a href="https://patshaughnessy.net/2015/11/24/a-look-at-how-postgres-executes-a-tiny-join">how Postgres implements the hash join
algorithm</a>.
I showed how Postgres scans over all the records in one of the tables from the
join and saves them in a hash table.</p>
<p>Here’s what a hash table might look like conceptually:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2016/1/22/table1.svg"/>
<p>On the left is an array of pointers called <em>buckets</em>. Each of these pointers is
the head of a linked list, which I show on the right using blue rectangles. The
rectangles represent values from one of the tables in the join. Postgres groups
the values into lists based on their hash values. By organizing the values from one
table like this, Postgres can later scan over a second table and repeatedly
search the hash table to perform the join efficiently. This algorithm is known
as a <em>hash join</em>.</p>
<p>Postgres’s hash join code gracefully scales up to process larger and larger
data sets by increasing the number of buckets. If the target table had more
records, Postgres would use 2048 buckets instead of 1024:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2016/1/22/table2.svg"/>
<p>Before starting to execute the hash join algorithm, Postgres estimates how many
records it will need to add to the hash table, using the query plan. Then
Postgres chooses a bucket count large enough to fit all of the records.</p>
<p>Postgres’s bucket count formula keeps the average linked list length less than
10 (the constant <span class="code">NTUP_PER_BUCKET</span> in the Postgres
source code), to avoid iterating over long lists. It also sets the bucket count
to a power of two, which allows Postgres to use C bitmask operations to assign
buckets to hash values. The least significant bits of the hash value for each
record becomes the bucket number.</p>
<p>If you’re curious, Postgres implements the bucket count formula in a C function
called <span class="code">ExecChooseHashTableSize</span>.</p>

</p>
<h2>How Large Can a Postgres Hash Table Grow?</h2>
<p>If the table from your join query was even larger, then Postgres would use 4096
buckets instead of 2048:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2016/1/22/table3.svg"/>
<p>In theory, this doubling of the bucket count could continue forever: 8192
buckets, 16384 buckets, etc. With 10 records per linked list, this would
accommodate 81,920 values, 163,840 values, etc.</p>
<p>In practice, as the total size of the data set being saved into the hash table
continues to increase Postgres will eventually run out of memory. But that
doesn’t seem to be an immediate problem, does it? Modern server hardware
contains tens or even hundreds of GBs - that is plenty of room to hold an
extremely large hash table.</p>
<p>But in fact, Postgres limits the size of each hash table to only 4MB! </p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2016/1/22/table4.svg"/>
<p>The rectangle I drew around the hash table above is the working memory buffer
assigned to that table. Regardless of how much memory my server hardware
actually has, Postgres won’t allow the hash table to consume more than 4MB.
This value is the <span class="code">work_mem</span> setting found in the
<span class="code">postgresql.conf</span> file.</p>
<p>At the same time Postgres calculates the number of buckets, it also calculates
the total amount of memory it expects the hash table to consume. If this amount
exceeds 4MB, Postgres divides the hash operation up into a series of <em>batches</em>:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2016/1/22/batches.svg"/>
<p>In this example, Postgres calculated that it would need up to 8MB to hold the
hash table. A larger join query might have many more batches, each holding 4MB
of data. Like the bucket count, Postgres sets the batch count to a power of two
also.  The first batch, shown on the left, contains the actual hash table in
memory.  The second batch, shown on the right, contains the records that won’t
fit into the 4MB hash table in the first batch.  Postgres assigns a batch
number to each record, along with the bucket number.  Then it saves the records
from the first batch into the hash table, and streams the remaining data out to
disk. Each batch gets its own temporary file.</p>
<p>Using an algorithm known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_join#Hybrid_hash_join">Hybrid hash
join</a>, Postgres first
searches the hash table already in memory. Then it streams all of the data back
from disk for the next batch, builds another hash table and searches it,
repeating this process for each batch.</p>
<br/>
<blockquote>
Note: Postgres actually holds a second hash table in memory, called the skew
table. For simplicity I’m not showing this in the diagram. This special hash
table is an optimization to handle hash values that occur frequently in the
data. Postgres saves the skew table inside the same 4MB working memory buffer,
so the primary hash table actually has a bit less than 4MB available to it.

<h2>Measuring Your SQL Statement’s Blood Pressure</h2>
<p>If one of the SQL queries in your application is running slowly, use the
<span class="code">EXPLAIN ANALYZE</span> to find out what’s going on:</p>
<pre style="font-size: 10px">
> explain analyze select title, company from publications, authors where author = name;

                                                          QUERY PLAN                                                           
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Join  (cost=2579.00..53605.00 rows=50000 width=72) (actual time=66.820..959.794 rows=21 loops=1)
   Hash Cond: ((authors.name)::text = (publications.author)::text)
   ->  Seq Scan on authors  (cost=0.00..20310.00 rows=1000000 width=50) (actual time=0.059..267.217 rows=1000000 loops=1)
   ->  Hash  (cost=1270.00..1270.00 rows=50000 width=88) (actual time=38.054..38.054 rows=50000 loops=1)
         Buckets: 4096  Batches: 2  Memory Usage: 2948kB
         ->  Seq Scan on publications  (cost=0.00..1270.00 rows=50000 width=88) (actual time=0.010..14.211 rows=50000 loops=1)
 Planning time: 0.489 ms
 Execution time: 960.482 ms
(8 rows)
</pre>
<p>Postgres’s <span class="code">EXPLAIN</span> command displays the query plan, a
tree data structure containing instructions that Postgres follows when it
executes the query. By using <span class="code">EXPLAIN ANALYZE</span> we ask
Postgres to execute the query also, displaying time and data metrics when its
finished. We can see in this example there were one million records in the
authors table and 50 thousand records in the publications table. At the bottom
we see that the join operation took a total of 960ms to finish.</p>
<p><span class="code">EXPLAIN ANALYZE</span> also tells us how many buckets and
batches the hash table used:</p>
<pre>
Buckets: 4096  Batches: 2  Memory Usage: 2948kB
</pre>
<p>Like my diagram above, this query used 2 batches: Only half of the data fit
into the 4MB working memory buffer! Postgres saved the other half of the data
in the file buffer.</p>
<h2>Increasing work_mem</h2>
<p>Now let’s increase the size of the working memory buffer by editing the <span
class="code">postgresql.conf</span> file and restarting the Postgres server.</p>
<p>First, I stop my Postgres server:</p>
<pre>
$ launchctl unload homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
</pre>
<p>Then I edit <span class="code">postgresql.conf</span>:</p>
<pre>
$ vim /usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf
</pre>
<p>…uncommenting and changing the setting:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2016/1/22/work_mem2.png"/>
<p>Finally I restart my server and repeat the test:</p>
<pre>
$ launchctl load homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
</pre>
<pre style="font-size: 10px">
> explain analyze select title, company from publications, authors where author = name;
                                                          QUERY PLAN                                                           
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Join  (cost=1895.00..32705.00 rows=50000 width=72) (actual time=59.224..624.716 rows=21 loops=1)
   Hash Cond: ((authors.name)::text = (publications.author)::text)
   ->  Seq Scan on authors  (cost=0.00..20310.00 rows=1000000 width=50) (actual time=0.031..146.327 rows=1000000 loops=1)
   ->  Hash  (cost=1270.00..1270.00 rows=50000 width=88) (actual time=34.436..34.436 rows=50000 loops=1)
         Buckets: 8192  Batches: 1  Memory Usage: 5860kB
         ->  Seq Scan on publications  (cost=0.00..1270.00 rows=50000 width=88) (actual time=0.008..13.382 rows=50000 loops=1)
 Planning time: 0.481 ms
 Execution time: 625.796 ms
(8 rows)
</pre>
<p>You can see the number of batches is now 1, and the memory usage increased to
5.8MB:</p>
<pre>
Buckets: 8192  Batches: 1  Memory Usage: 5860kB
</pre>
<p>Postgres was able to use a working memory buffer size larger than 4MB. This
allowed it to save the entire data set into a single, in memory hash table and
avoid using temporary buffer files. </p>
<p>Because of this, the total execution time decreased from 960ms to 625ms:</p>
<img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2016/1/22/chart.png"/>
<h2>Too Good To Be True</h2>
<p>If memory intensive Postgres SQL statements could run so much faster, why does
Postgres use only 4MB by default for the working memory buffer size? In this
example I increased <span class="code">work_mem</span> modestly from 4MB to
8MB - why not increase it to 1GB or 10GB? Why not use all of your server’s
available memory to run all of your SQL statements as fast as possible, all of
the time? That’s why you bought that fat box to host your Postgres server,
isn’t it?</p>
<p>This result seems too easy, too good to be true. And it is.</p>
<p>Database servers like Postgres are optimized to handle many small, concurrent
requests at the same time. Each request needs its own working memory buffer.
Not only that, each SQL statement Postgres executes might require multiple
memory buffers, one for each join or sort operation the query plan calls for.</p>

  <img src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2016/1/22/bp1.png"><br/>
</div>
<p>My Postgres server isn’t entirely dedicated to executing this one example SQL
statement and nothing else. By increasing the value of <span
class="code">work_mem</span>, I’ve increased it server-wide for every request,
not just for my one slow hash join. Given the same amount of total RAM
available on the server box, increasing <span class="code">work_mem</span>
means Postgres can handle fewer concurrent requests before running out of
memory.</p>
<p>However, it certainly might be the case that 8MB or some larger value for <span
class="code">work_mem</span> is appropriate given the amount of memory I have,
and the number of concurrent connections I expect.</p>
<p>Be smart about how you configure your Postgres server. Don’t blindly accept the
default values, or guess what they should be at the moment you install
Postgres. Instead, after your application is finished and running in
production, look for memory intensive SQL statements. Measure the SQL queries
your application actually executes. Take their blood pressure using the <span
class="code">EXPLAIN ANALYZE</span> command; you might find they are memory
starved!</p>
