<i> Learning something new every day
is exercise for your mind.</i><br/>

<p>As software developers we’re paid to be professional learners. People hire us
(or should hire us) for what we are capable of learning, not for what we
already know. To stay in shape and keep up with our peers we need to practice
by learning something new every day. We need to get daily exercise for our
minds.</p>
<p>For me the best way to do this is to make simple tasks harder. Many times each
day I need to copy files, parse XML, generate JSON, or send an HTTP request.
The boring daily chores of a modern knowledge worker. To make my life more
interesting and to exercise my mind, I sometimes choose new tools or
programming languages that are harder to use, not easier, to accomplish these
small tasks.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example. Recently I needed to run a simple SQL query on a
Postgres database and produce a one-off report. I could have done this in 5
minutes using Ruby and ActiveRecord. Instead, I decided to use
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> and <a href="http://diesel.rs">Diesel</a> - a language
and a tool I hadn’t used before. Instead of 5 minutes it took several hours,
but I learned something new. I've written up the steps I took here today. Get
your mind’s exercise for today and read on to learn how to execute a SQL
statement using Rust.</p>
<p><b>TL/DR</b>: I posted <a href="https://gist.github.com/patshaughnessy/db735e90d58376fdd550b35838aa5339">the
code</a>
from this article if you want to skip the explanation and just try it.</p>
<h2>Running a SQL Query Using Ruby and ActiveRecord</h2>
<p>My actual data set looked different, but suppose as an example I had a Postgres
table called <span class="code">users</span>:</p>
<pre>
create table users (
    id serial primary key,
    first_name varchar(40),
    last_name  varchar(40)
);
</pre>
<p>…and I needed to count the number of users with multiple last names. People
from Spanish speaking countries, like my wife, often have two last names.
Because I was in a rush and had to get an answer quickly, I turned to
ActiveRecord. This simple Ruby script ran a SQL query and also a bit of Ruby
post-processing to find the number of users with multiple last names:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#ffffff;">
<span style="color:#000000;">
</span><span style="color:#000000;">user_groups </span><span style="color:#4f5b66;">= </span><span style="color:#008080;">User</span><span style="color:#000000;">.all.partition </span><span style="color:#a71d5d;">do </span><span style="color:#4f5b66;">|</span><span style="color:#000000;">user</span><span style="color:#4f5b66;">|
</span><span style="color:#000000;">  user.last_name.split.size </span><span style="color:#4f5b66;">&gt; </span><span style="color:#d08770;">1
</span><span style="color:#a71d5d;">end
</span><span style="color:#000000;">
</span><span style="color:#000000;">puts </span><span style="color:#4f5b66;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#008080;">Found </span><span style="color:#000000;">#{user_groups.first.size}</span><span style="color:#008080;"> users with more than one last name.</span><span style="color:#4f5b66;">&quot;
</span><span style="color:#000000;">puts </span><span style="color:#4f5b66;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#008080;">Found </span><span style="color:#000000;">#{user_groups.last.size}</span><span style="color:#008080;"> users with one last name.</span><span style="color:#4f5b66;">&quot;
</span></pre>

<p>Ruby and ActiveRecord worked brilliantly. I was done. Neither the language nor
the tools got in my way and I had the quick answer I needed. After just five
minutes I moved on to more important work.</p>
<h2>Time to Exercise My Mind</h2>
<p>I had a quick answer, but didn’t learn anything. I realized that if I spent all
of my time getting my work done as quickly as possible and never learned
anything new, I’d fall behind in the long run.</p>
<p>Because this task was so simple, I decided to try to write the same report
using Rust instead of Ruby. But how? Rust is a much more complex, low level
language than Ruby is. How in the world could I learn about its type system,
its borrow checker, its compiler/build tools, its debugging tools and, of
course, its language syntax without spending months and months reading books?</p>
<p>The answer was just to try it. And what better way to try a new language than
to work on a simple task like this. It was time for my daily exercise.</p>
<p>First, I installed <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html">Rust</a>, poked
around the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/index.html">The Rust Programming
Language</a> book a bit,
and read the excellent <a href="http://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started/">Diesel
tutorial</a>. Rust has great
documentation and getting up to speed with this extremely complex language is
just a matter of time, focus and attention. Then I rewrote that simple
Ruby/ActiveRecord report script above using Rust and Diesel. Here’s how I did
it.</p>
<h2>A New Rust Project</h2>
<p>To get started, I created a new Rust project using
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/">Cargo</a>:</p>
<pre>
$ cargo new last_names --bin
     Created binary (application) `last_names` project
$ cd last_names
$ cargo build
   Compiling last_names v0.1.0 (file:///Users/pat/path/to/last_names)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 7.68 secs
$ target/debug/last_names
Hello, world!
</pre>
<p>As you can see, Cargo got me started quickly, and I was able to print “Hello
World” with just a few commands.</p>
<p>Cargo placed the source code in a Rust file called src/main.rs, which looks
like this:</p>
<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2018/6/9/hello-world.png"/>
<p>As a comparison, I show the equivalent Ruby code below in pink. Pretty simple.</p>
<h2>From Gemfile to Cargo.toml</h2>
<p>I knew my script needed to connect to Postgres and execute a SQL statement, so
I added Diesel as a dependency to my Cargo.toml file:</p>
<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2018/6/9/cargo-toml.png"/>
<p>Cargo is a dependency manager similar to Ruby’s <a href="https://bundler.io">Bundler</a>.
The Cargo.toml file lists the Rust libraries, or “crates,” that my script will
use. It plays the same role as the Gemfile does for Ruby projects.</p>
<p>Then I installed Diesel by running “cargo build” again:</p>
<pre>
$ cargo build
    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
 Downloading diesel v1.3.0
 Downloading pq-sys v0.4.5

etc…

  Compiling diesel_derives v1.3.0
   Compiling diesel v1.3.0
   Compiling last_names v0.1.0 (file:///Users/pat/path/to/last_names)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 47.30 secs
</pre>
<h2>Connecting to Postgres</h2>
<p>Ok now I’m ready to start working on my report code, back in main.rs. The first
thing I need to do is open a connection to Postgres. After that, I can figure
out how to execute my report.</p>
<p>Here’s how I did it - again I show the Rust code in grey and the equivalent
Ruby code below in pink:</p>
<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2018/6/9/connect.png"/>
<p>The Rust code is fairly simple and easy to understand: It just passes a
Postgres connection string to <span
class="code">PgConnection::establish</span>. One interesting and important
detail here is the call to <span class="code">expect</span>. <span
class="code">PgConnection::establish</span> returns a <span
class="code">ConnectionResult<T></span> value, which is derived from the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html">Result enum</a>:</p>
<img width="200" src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2018/6/9/result.png"/>
<p>As <em>The Rust Programming Language</em>
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch09-00-error-handling.html">explains</a>,
<span class="code">expect</span> checks whether the result value contains <span
class="code">Ok</span> or <span class="code">Err</span>. If it contains <span
class="code">Err</span>, <span class="code">expect</span> prints out the given
error message.</p>
<p>Assuming my Postgres server is up and running and contains a database called
“names,” I can now compile, run my Rust script and connect to Postgres:</p>
<pre>
$ cargo build
   Compiling last_names v0.1.0 (file:///Users/pat/path/to/last_names)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.71 secs
$ target/debug/last_names
Connected!
</pre>
<p>Stepping back for a moment, the Ruby and Rust versions of this code are
actually very similar. However, the Rust version is a bit more complex because
I have to explicitly handle the possibility that <span
class="code">PgConnection::establish</span> might return an error. In Ruby I
can ignore this possibility, although my script would crash if <span
class="code">ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection</span> ran into a problem
and raised an exception.</p>
<h2>Inspecting My Postgres Column Types</h2>
<p>Using Ruby, ActiveRecord automatically inspects my database table and creates
methods on my model class for each column. But in Rust, I have to type in code
that declares each Postgres table and column I plan to use. (Actually, Diesel
can also inspect my database columns automatically using the <span
class="code">infer_schema!</span> macro, but as a beginner I find it easier to
type this information in explicitly.)</p>
<p>Fortunately, Diesel provides a command line tool that makes this easy:</p>
<pre>
$ diesel print-schema --database-url=postgres://pat@patshaughnessy.net:5432/names --whitelist users
table! {
    users (id) {
        id -> Int4,
        first_name -> Nullable&lt;Varchar>,
        last_name -> Nullable&lt;Varchar>,
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The diesel tool printed out a series of Rust macros that declare the name of my
Postgres table, and the names and types of each of the table’s columns. Notice
that I provided two command line parameters: the Postgres connection string and
my database table name.</p>
<p>The Diesel macros resemble the original SQL definition of my Postgres table:</p>
<img width="676" src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2018/6/9/sql-to-macro.png"/>
<p>Diesel used <span class="code">Int4</span> for the primary key column, and
<span class="code">Nullable&lt;Varchar&gt;</span> for each of the Postgres varchar
string columns. <span class="code">Nullable</span> must mean that my Postgres
SQL schema allows null values for <span class="code">first_name</span> and
<span class="code">last_name</span>. In other words, it means that I didn’t
specify <span class="code">NOT NULL</span> for these columns in my
<span class="code">CREATE TABLE</span> command.</p>
<h2>Creating a Model</h2>
<p>Next, using these macros as a guide, I wrote a Rust struct to serve as my
database model. An instance of this struct was going to represent each row in
my Postgres table:</p>
<img width="692" src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2018/6/9/macro-to-model.png"/>
<p>Just as Diesel mapped each Postgres column type to a Rust macro with the
corresponding type, I had to choose a Rust type for each Postgres column in my
new struct. For the id column, I picked Rust’s <span class="code">i32</span>
integer type. This made sense because the <span class="code">Int4</span>
implied a 4 byte or 32 bit integer value. And for each of the string columns, I
chose the Rust <span class="code">String</span> type.</p>
<p>Finally, I pasted all of this into my main.rs source code file, as follows:</p>
<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2018/6/9/model.png"/>
<p>Reading this over, the Ruby version is much more concise. In Rust I specified
the name and type of each column, while in Ruby ActiveRecord figured all of
that out for me. (Although as I mentioned above, I could have asked Diesel to
detect the column types automatically also.)</p>
<h2>Trying to Execute a SQL Statement in Rust</h2>
<p>Now after all of this setup, I’m finally ready to execute my report. Here’s the
Rust code I wrote inside the <span class="code">main()</span> function, following the call to
<span class="code">PgConnection::establish</span>:</p>
<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2018/6/9/trying.png"/>
<p>It took me a while to figure out the proper syntax, especially the bits that
use generic type notation, like <span class="code">Vec&lt;User&gt;</span> and <span
class="code">Vec&lt;&amp;str&gt;</span>. Also the <span
class="code">.collect::&lt;Vec&lt;&amp;str&gt;&gt;()</span> code seemed a bit odd to me as
well, because it includes a type inside a function name. The reason for this
complex notation is that the <span class="code">collect</span> function
converts the iterator returned by <span class="code">split</span> into an
array, but the Rust compiler needs to know what type of values will be in that
array. Rust normally uses type inference to figure this out, but in this case
there’s no way for it to know. Therefore, I needed to specify the <span
class="code">Vec&lt;&amp;str&gt;</span> type manually, telling Rust I wanted an array of
string references.</p>
<p>But in the end I was surprised how similar the Rust and Ruby versions of this
code are! Both load all the user records into memory in a similar way, although
the Rust version has to check for errors explicitly. And both Rust and Ruby use
<span class="code">partition</span> with a closure that checks whether each
last name string contains multiple words or not, by calling <span
class="code">split</span>.</p>
<p>I was very excited to try this out, so I ran the Rust compiler:</p>
<pre>
$ cargo build
   Compiling last_names v0.1.0 (file:///Users/pat/path/to/last_names)

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
</pre>
<p>Ugh - what happened? I started to realize how difficult error messages from the
Rust compiler can be to understand, especially for beginners like me.</p>
<p>And I certainly didn’t want to try the “—verbose” option the Rust compiler
suggested. This message was already verbose enough!</p>
<h2>Rust’s Type System Keeps Me Out of Trouble</h2>
<p>After a while, I realized what the problem was. Reading the error message again
more carefully, I saw the line:</p>
<pre>
diesel::sql_types::Nullable<diesel::sql_types::Text> ...is not satisfied
</pre>
<p>Ah - the problem must have to do with the <span class="code">Nullable</span>
macro the Diesel utility generated for me. That indicated that my underlying
Postgres column allowed null values. At first, I thought maybe I should add
<span class="code">NOT NULL</span> to my Postgres table and prevent users with
null last names. That must be the answer.</p>
<p>But thinking about this some more, I realized that maybe having no last name is
a valid state. That some people really don’t have last names… Bono, Lady Gaga,
or Sting. Or maybe these are their last names and they have no first names?
Either way it seemed to me that my report code should handle null values, and
that it shouldn’t make assumptions about what’s in the data set.</p>
<p>I decided to adapt my Rust code to make this work, and to do that I needed a
way of saving null values in my User struct. The problem, what the Rust
compiler was trying to tell me, was that my User struct could not handle nulls
as written. I needed to use an option type instead:</p>
<img width="693" src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2018/6/9/option-model.png"/>
<p>Like the <span class="code">Result</span> enum we saw above, <span
class="code">Option</span> is an enum that can contain either <span
class="code">Some</span> or <span class="code">None</span>… i.e. a null value:</p>
<img width="170" src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2018/6/9/option.png"/>
<p>To learn more about the <span class="code">Option</span> type, read <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html#the-option-enum-and-its-advantages-over-null-values">Chapter
6</a>
from <em>The Rust Programming Language</em>.</p>
<p>After changing my <span class="code">User</span> struct, I then had to rework
the closure inside of <span class="code">partition</span>. Here’s what I ended
up with:</p>
<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2018/6/9/unwrap.png"/>
<p>I wrote <span class="code">if let Some(ref name)</span> to check whether or not
the last name of each user struct was null. In other words, I “unwrapped” the
last name. The <span class="code">ref</span> keyword satisfies Rust’s borrow
checker, which enforces Rust’s unique and innovative memory ownership model.
Without <span class="code">ref</span>, the Rust compiler would give me another
error: “cannot move out of borrowed content.” To learn more about Rust’s
ownership model, see <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">Chapter
4</a>
of <em>The Rust Programming Language</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, I compiled and ran my Rust code, and saw the results I expected:</p>
<pre>
$ target/debug/last_names
Connected!
Found 20 users with more than one last name.
Found 80 users with one last name.
</pre>
<p>As a test, I tried adding a user with no last name and got the expected results - the
user with no last name was counted as if they had one:</p>
<pre>
$ psql names
psql (9.6.3)
Type "help" for help.
names=# INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('Bono', NULL);
INSERT 0 1
names=# \q

$ target/debug/last_names
Connected!
Found 20 users with more than one last name.
Found 81 users with one last name.
</pre>
<p>But when I reran my original Ruby code with a null last name, it crashed!</p>
<pre>
$ ruby main.rb
Connected.
main.rb:18:in `block in \<main\>': undefined method `split' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
</pre>
<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2018/6/9/fix-ruby.png"/>
<p>Rewriting my Ruby code in Rust revealed a bug I never knew I had. As shown
above, I had to rework my Ruby code to check for a null last name inside the
block, similar to what I wrote in Rust. Even though it required more typing and
more work, Rust’s strict type system told me my code might crash at compile
time, while Ruby didn't tell me anything was wrong until runtime.</p>
<h2>Rust vs. Ruby</h2>
<p>In the end I was able to rewrite my Ruby code in Rust and get the same results.
<a href="https://gist.github.com/patshaughnessy/db735e90d58376fdd550b35838aa5339">This
gist</a>
contains the Rust code I ended up with, if you’re interested in trying this
yourself.</p>
<p>Writing the same algorithm in both languages and comparing, I noticed a few
obvious differences. First, the runtime execution performance was far superior
using Rust. I was able to load and process large sets of User records much,
much faster using Rust. But development performance was better using Ruby.  The
speed at which I was able to write working code was faster using Ruby.  It took
minutes to write the Ruby version, but hours to write the Rust version.  Of
course, I’m a Rust novice. An experienced Rust developer who knew what they
were doing could probably have written this in just a few minutes as well.
Second, Ruby is concise, while Rust is verbose. It took much more typing to
write Rust. But this extra thoroughness led me to find a bug in my Ruby code I
never knew I had.</p>
<p>Which language is better? Neither. Ruby and Rust are different tools that are
best used in different circumstances.</p>
<p>In the end what matters is that I learned something. One language isn’t better
than another - but now I’m a better developer because I took the time to learn
something new. By taking 5 hours instead of 5 minutes to accomplish a simple
task, I gained valuable insight and knowledge. I gave my mind the exercise it
was so hungry for. And thankfully no one noticed it took me 5 hours to run a
report that should have taken 5 minutes.</p>
