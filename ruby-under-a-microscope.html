Its dynamic nature allows you to concisely write the code you need to actually solve a problem instead of burying yourself under mountains of boilerplate. You don't have to fight it; you just get to enjoy the ride.</p><p>But how is the magic created? And can you trust it? After all, MRI is written in C - a statically typed, compiled language which is pretty much the antithesis of Ruby. What <span>dark voodoo</span> is breathed into C to enable Ruby's features - closures, metaprogramming, and so much more?</p><h1>Find out with Science!</h1><p>Ruby Under a Microscope will guide you through the internals of some of Ruby's
                most-used facets. Using experimentation, theory, and two truckloads of diagrams,
                you'll <span>clearly see how Ruby is implemented</span>.</p><div class="diagram"><img src="/assets/images/tokenize.png"></img><div class="caption">Here's just one of the diagrams out of the two truckloads.</div><div class="caption">Did you think that was a exaggeration? Well, it isn't!</div></div><p>Here's a science fact for you: before they understood the nature of combustion,
                 Enlightenment chemists believed fire resulted from the release of a negative-weight
                 particle called "phlogiston". Then Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier knocked that theory
                 on its derri&egrave;re by discovering oxygen and proving how combustion really works.</p><p>This book will offer you the same clarity. Instead of pointing at a Ruby block and
                 yelling, &quot;Phlogiston!&quot;, you'll be able to lucidly explain how Ruby copies
                 variables from the stack to the heap in order to allow access to them even after
                 a function has returned.</p><p>Have no clue what that means? Well, that's exactly why you need to read this book.</p><p>And good news: you don't need to know a lick of C! If you can't tell your pointers
                 from your pointers to pointers, then have no fear. <span>Ruby Under a Microscope is accessible to anyone</span> with an interest in learning how Ruby works internally.</p><h1>People Already Love It</h1><p>Here's what people are already saying about <span>Ruby Under a Microscope</span>:</p><blockquote><div class="pic"><img src="/assets/images/avatars/peter.png"></img></div><div class="content">Many people have dug into the Ruby source code but few make it back out
                   and tell the tale as elegantly as Pat does in Ruby Under A Microscope! I
                   particularly love the diagrams - and there are lots of them - as they
                   make many opaque implementation topics a lot easier to understand,
                   especially when coupled with Pat's gentle narrative. This book is a
                   delight for language implementation geeks and Rubyists with a penchant
                   for digging into the guts of their tools.<footer>&ndash;<cite>Peter Cooper (<a href="https://twitter.com/peterc">@peterc</a>) &mdash; Editor of Ruby Inside and Ruby Weekly</cite></footer></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="pic"><img src="/assets/images/avatars/xavier.jpg"></img></div><div class="content">going to proofread a draft of @pat_shaughnessy's &quot;Ruby Under a Microscope&quot;, man this book was missing in the Ruby landscape, awesome content<footer>&ndash;<cite>Xavier Noria (<a href="https://twitter.com/fxn">@fxn</a>) &mdash; Ruby Hero, Ruby on Rails Core Team Member</cite></footer></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="pic"><img src="/assets/images/avatars/santiago.jpg"></img></div><div class="content">Pat Shaughnessy did a tremendous job writing THE book about Ruby internals.

Your writing made very complex topics (at least for me) very accessible and I found the book hard to put down. Diagrams were awesome and already are popping in my head as I code.
